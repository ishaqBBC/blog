## TLDR

AWS’s three-tier architecture involves public subnets for Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs), [private subnets](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-15-11-aws-78-VPC/) for [EC2](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-24-aws-10-EC2/) instances, and deeper [private subnets](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-15-11-aws-78-VPC/) for databases and caching solutions. It’s designed to optimise scalability, security, and performance. Understanding this architecture helps developers design robust cloud applications and ace relevant certification exams.

### The Role of VPC in AWS Architecture

A Virtual Private Cloud ([VPC](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-11-01-aws-77-VPC-intro/)) forms the foundation of AWS network architecture, enabling you to segment and manage your cloud resources securely. Before diving into three-tier solutions, understanding [VPC](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-11-01-aws-77-VPC-intro/)s—public and [private subnets](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-15-11-aws-78-VPC/), route tables, and gateways—is essential.

### Breaking Down the Three-Tier Architecture

Three-tier architecture is a common design pattern in cloud applications, built for scalability, fault tolerance, and enhanced security. Here’s how it works:

1. **Public Subnets: The Front Door**

   - **Elastic Load Balancer ([ELB](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/ElasticLoadBalancing/2023-08-12-aws-28-ELB/))**: Positioned in public subnets, the [ELB](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/ElasticLoadBalancing/2023-08-12-aws-28-ELB/) manages incoming traffic, distributing it across multiple availability zones (AZs).
   - **Route 53**: A DNS service directs users to the [ELB](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/ElasticLoadBalancing/2023-08-12-aws-28-ELB/) for seamless connectivity.

2. **[private subnets](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-15-11-aws-78-VPC/)**

   - **[EC2](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-24-aws-10-EC2/) Instances in Auto Scaling Groups**: These instances process requests but remain private, accessible only via the [ELB](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/ElasticLoadBalancing/2023-08-12-aws-28-ELB/).
   - **Security**: Isolating [EC2](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-24-aws-10-EC2/) instances in [private subnets](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-15-11-aws-78-VPC/) protects them from direct internet exposure while ensuring traffic flows efficiently through route tables.

3. **Data Subnets**
   - **Amazon [RDS](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-12-22-aws-46-RDS/)**: The managed database service stores and retrieves application data.
   - **[ElastiCache](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-02-09-aws-53-ElastiCache/)**: Acts as an in-memory data store for caching, reducing latency and offloading [RDS](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-12-22-aws-46-RDS/) queries.

This structured approach isolates each layer.

### [LAMP](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/lamp-stack/) Stack on AWS

The [LAMP](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/lamp-stack/) stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) illustrates how this architecture can power real-world applications. For example:

- **Linux**: Operates the underlying [EC2](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-24-aws-10-EC2/) instances.
- **Apache**: Serves as the web server.
- **MySQL**: Utilises Amazon [RDS](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-12-22-aws-46-RDS/) for database management.
- **PHP**: Processes application logic and renders web pages.

Adding caching solutions like [ElastiCache](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-02-09-aws-53-ElastiCache/) or local EBS storage further enhances performance.

### Simplifying WordPress Deployment

For a WordPress deployment on AWS:

- **Load Balancer Tier**: Directs traffic to [EC2](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-24-aws-10-EC2/) instances.
- **Application Tier**: [EC2](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-24-aws-10-EC2/) instances handle requests and share user-uploaded images.
  - **EFS**: Ensures all [EC2](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-24-aws-10-EC2/) instances can access shared files like images, stored securely in a network file system.

AWS provides a detailed WordPress architecture, incorporating additional components like NAT gateways, Aurora databases, and CloudFront. While these advanced elements are beyond this discussion, they highlight the flexibility and power of AWS’s solutions.

## Conclusion

Understanding AWS’s [VPC](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-11-01-aws-77-VPC-intro/) structure and three-tier architecture is foundational for developers and architects alike. By mastering these principles, you can design secure, scalable, and performant applications—whether deploying a [LAMP](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/lamp-stack/) stack, a WordPress site, or a custom solution. Explore the diagrams and documentation to solidify these concepts and prepare for certification exams or real-world projects.
