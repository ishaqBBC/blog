## TLDR

The AWS credentials chain defines the priority AWS follows to authenticate requests, starting with command line options or system properties, then environment variables, profile files, and finally ECS/EC2 credentials. Always avoid hardcoding credentials, use IAM roles within AWS, and follow the principle of least privilege to ensure secure and efficient operations.

## Introduction

When working with Amazon Web Services (AWS), there is a concept of the **credentials chain**. This is the order in which AWS looks for permissions to authenticate your requests, whether you are using the **AWS CLI**, an **SDK**, or running workloads on **EC2** or **ECS**. 

For more in-depth learning, visit the [AWS Skills Builder website](https://aws.amazon.com/training/skills-builder/). This platform offers a variety of resources to help with AWS concepts, including the credentials chain, and prepare for certification exams.


## The AWS CLI Credentials Chain

When you use the [**AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)**](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-10-03-aws-7-cli), it checks for credentials in a strict priority order:

1. **Command line options**  
   - If you specify credentials directly (for example, using `--region`, `--profile`, `--access-key-id`, `--secret-access-key`, or `--session-token`), these always take precedence.

2. **Environment variables**  
   - If no command line options are set, AWS looks at environment variables such as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`.

3. **CLI credentials file**  
   - These are the credentials saved when you run `aws configure`.

4. **CLI configuration file**  
   - Similar in structure to the credentials file but used for broader configuration such as region and output format.

5. **Container credentials**  
   - If running in **Amazon ECS**, AWS checks whether credentials have been assigned to the task.

6. **EC2 instance profile credentials**  
   - Finally, if the workload is running on **Amazon EC2**, the CLI looks for credentials associated with the EC2 instance role.

**Summary:** Command line options have the highest priority. EC2/ECS instance profile credentials have the lowest.


## The SDK Credentials Chain

If you’re using an SDK — for example, the **Java SDK** — the process is similar but with slight variations:

1. **System properties**  
   - Java-specific system properties (e.g., `aws.accessKeyId`).

2. **Environment variables**  
   - Credentials set in your system environment.

3. **Default profile files**  
   - The same profile files created by the CLI.

4. **ECS container credentials**  

5. **EC2 instance profile credentials**

**Key point:** Environment variables still override [EC2/ECS instance profiles](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-24-aws-10-EC2/).


## A Real-World Scenario

Imagine this situation:  
You deploy an application on an **EC2 instance**. You configure **environment variables** using IAM user credentials that have **S3 FullAccess**. This gives your app unrestricted access to *all* S3 buckets.  

Later, you follow best practices:  
- You create an **IAM role** with minimal permissions (access to just one bucket).  
- You attach this role to the EC2 instance via an **instance profile**.  

Yet the application **still** has full access to every bucket. Why?  

The answer lies in the credentials chain. The **environment variables** you set earlier take priority over the instance profile. To fix this, you must **unset those environment variables** so that the application falls back to using the instance profile and its restricted permissions.  

This is a common exam scenario — and a real-world pitfall.



## Best Practices for AWS Credentials

- **Never store credentials in your code.** This is one of the worst security practices.  
- **Within AWS, always use IAM roles.**  
  - EC2 -> Instance roles  
  - ECS ->  Task roles  
  - Lambda ->  Execution roles  
- **Outside AWS, use environment variables or named profiles.**  
- **Always apply the principle of least privilege.** Give your application only the permissions it actually needs.



## Conclusion

The AWS credentials chain is easy to overlook but  important for both secure operations and certification success. Remember the order of priority, and always favour [**IAM roles**](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-17-aws-9-roles/) over hardcoded credentials.  

By following these principles, you’ll avoid  risks and  your applications will run with the right level of access.
