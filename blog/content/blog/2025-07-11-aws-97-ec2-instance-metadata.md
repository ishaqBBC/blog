## TLDR
EC2 Instance Metadata [(IMDS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html) is a way for your cloud computer (an EC2 instance) to learn about itself. It doesn’t need special permissions. It just asks a secret web address for details. There are two versions: IMDSv1 (easy but less secure) and IMDSv2 (more steps but safer).


## Refreshers EC2s?

**EC2** think of it as a computer living in the cloud of Amazon Web Services (AWS). To run websites, apps ..etc just like a normal computer.

EC2 is clever because:
It can tell you things about itself, without you needing to log in or give it a password. That’s where **IMDS** comes in.

## The Instance Metadata Service

**IMDS** stands for **Instance Metadata Service**. It’s a helper that lives inside every [EC2](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-24-aws-10-EC2/) computer. It knows:

* Instance name
* Public IP address
* Private IP address
* [The IAM Role](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-03-aws-5-IAM-polices/)

This info is called **metadata** — meaning *“data about the instance.”*

---

## Where Does the Info Come From?

Your EC2 instance communicates with a special web address:

```bash
http://169.254.169.254/ 
```

This address isn’t on the internet. It only works *inside* the EC2 instance.

When the instance asks that address, it gets its own metadata — like reading your own name tag.


## What’s the Difference Between Metadata and User Data?

* **Metadata** = Info *about* the EC2 instance
* **User data** = A script or instructions that run when the instance starts

They both live behind the same special address, but we’re focusing on metadata for now.


## IMDSv1 vs IMDSv2

There are **two versions** of this service:

### IMDSv1

* Simple and easy
* Just go to the URL and done!
* But not very secure

###  IMDSv2

* More secure
* You must *ask for permission* first (get a token)
* Then you can use that token to ask for metadata

From 2023, **IMDSv2 is the default** on new EC2 instances.

It’s a bit more work, but it keeps your cloud computer safer and secure.

More Information about IMDS version 1 and 2 [HERE](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/get-the-full-benefits-of-imdsv2-and-disable-imdsv1-across-your-aws-infrastructure/)


### Conclusion

Working with EC2 and using metadata is powerful. Build smarter apps, automatic scripts, and make things more secure all by asking your instance to tell you about itself.

Kit comes standard with all EC2 instances.

In the next post, I will show you *how* to use IMDS step by step. You’ll see how to fetch info using both IMDSv1 and IMDSv2.
