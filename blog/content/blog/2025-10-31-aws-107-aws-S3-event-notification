title: "AWS 107: Amazon S3 Event Notification"
date: 2025-10-31T12:20:03.526Z

# Intro
When something happens in your [s3 bucket](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2025-03-21-aws-85-Amazon-s3-hands-on/), that is called an **event**.  
An event could be when a file is added, removed, copied, or restored.  

You can also choose which events you want to notice.  
For example:  “Events when the file ends with `.jpg`.”  

## Why Event Notifications?

Event Notifications **react automatically** to changes in your [s3 bucket](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2025-03-21-aws-85-Amazon-s3-hands-on/).  
For example, when someone uploads an image, you might want to make a small version of it called a **thumbnail**.  
To do this, you can signal S3 to send a message when a new image arrives.  



## Where Do the Notifications Go?

Your S3 Event Notification can be sent to different places:

- **SNS topic** – to send a message to many people or systems. [Learn more about SNS topics in the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html).   
- **SQS queue** – to store messages until another service reads them. [Learn more about SQS queues in the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/welcome.html).  
- **Lambda function** – to run code as soon as the event happens. [Learn more about Lambda functions in the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html).   

You can have many event notifications and send them wherever you need.  
Most of the time, the event arrives within seconds, but sometimes it can take a bit longer.  

## Permissions and Policies

For Event Notifications to work, S3 needs **permission** to send messages.  

Here’s how that works:
- For **SNS**, we use an **SNS resource access policy**. [Learn more about SNS resource access policies in the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-access-policy-use-cases.html).  
- For **SQS**, we use an **SQS resource access policy**. [Learn more about SQS resource access policies in the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-creating-custom-policies.html).  
- For **Lambda**, we use a **Lambda resource policy**. [Learn more about Lambda resource policies in the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-resource-based.html).    

These policies tell AWS, “S3 is allowed to send data here.”  
They are like special rules that keep your system safe.  

## EventBridge Integration

There is also a new way to use Event Notifications.  
Every event in your [s3 bucket](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2025-03-21-aws-85-Amazon-s3-hands-on/) can go to **Amazon EventBridge**.  
[Learn more about Amazon EventBridge in the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is.html).   

EventBridge can then send those events to more than **18 AWS services**, such as:
- **Step Functions**  
- **Kinesis Data Streams**  
- **Firehose**

With EventBridge, you can filter by file name, size, or other details.  
You can also **archive** and **replay** events if needed.  
This makes EventBridge very powerful and flexible.  

Below is a diagram of the process

## Conclusion

Amazon S3 Event Notifications let you respond quickly when things happen in your bucket.  
You can send those events to **SNS**, **SQS**, **Lambda**, or **EventBridge**.  
This helps your applications stay smart and react on their own.
