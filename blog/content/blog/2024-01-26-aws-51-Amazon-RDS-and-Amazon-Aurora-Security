## TLDR

Explores the security features of [RDS](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-12-22-aws-46-RDS/) and [Aurora](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-01-12-aws-49-Amazon-Aurora/) databases on AWS. It covers encryption at rest using [Key Management Service (KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/), in-flight encryption between clients and databases, authentication options including [IAM roles](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-17-aws-9-roles/), network access control through security groups, limited [SSH access](https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-ssh-access-everything-you-need-to-know) through the RDS custom service, and the use of Audit Logs to monitor database activity. The goal is to simplify the understanding of complex database security measures.

## Encryption at Rest

Let's talk about encrypting your data when it's at rest on Relational Database Service [RDS](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-12-22-aws-46-RDS/) and [Aurora](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-01-12-aws-49-Amazon-Aurora/) databases. This involves encrypting data on the [volumes](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-06-16-aws-21-EBS-volume-types/). During the initial launch of your database, you can define encryption settings. The master database and any replicas can be encrypted using [Key Management Service (KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/). If the master isn't encrypted, read replicas can't be either. If you need to encrypt an existing unencrypted database, take a snapshot, and then restore it as an encrypted one. It's a snapshot and restore operation.

## In-Flight Encryption

Moving on to in-flight encryption, which secures data transmission between clients and your database. Every RDS and Aurora database is set up for in-flight encryption by default. Clients need to use [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) [root certificates](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ssl-certificate/) from AWS, available on the AWS website.

## Authentication Options

When it comes to authentication, the classic username and password combo is available. However, since it's AWS, you can also leverage [IAM roles](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-17-aws-9-roles/) for connecting to your database. This means [EC2 instances](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-24-aws-10-EC2/#instance) with [IAM roles](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-17-aws-9-roles/) can authenticate directly, avoiding the need for a username and password.

## Network Access Control

Control network access to your database using security groups. Specify which ports, IP addresses, or security groups are allowed or blocked.

## No SSH Access

RDS and Aurora are managed services and typically don't offer [SSH access](https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-ssh-access-everything-you-need-to-know). But, if you use the [RDS](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-12-22-aws-46-RDS/) custom service from AWS, you can get [SSH access](https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-ssh-access-everything-you-need-to-know).

## Audit Logs

If you want to keep an eye on queries and database activity over time, enable Audit Logs. However, these logs have a shelf life. To preserve them for an extended period, send them to the CloudWatch Logs service on AWS.
