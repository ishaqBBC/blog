## TLDR

An Overview of Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for the AWS Certified Developer – Associate Exam. This includes VPC Basics, Subnets, Internet Gateways, NAT Gateways, Security Groups, Network ACLs, VPC Flow Logs, VPC Peering, VPC Endpoints, Site-to-Site VPN, and Direct Connect.

# Introduction to VPC: Virtual Private Cloud

Welcome to this section on **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**  a foundational concept in AWS networking that you’ll need to grasp to confidently tackle AWS certifications and build secure, scalable architectures in the cloud. Here, we’ll cover VPC basics at a high level, tailored for the **AWS Certified Developer – Associate** exam.

## Why VPC Matters for Your AWS Certification

While in-depth VPC knowledge is crucial for the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate** and **Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate** exams, the developer-level certification generally focuses on a higher-level understanding. Expect about 1-3 exam questions on VPC topics, so a general grasp will set you up well. This overview is designed to provide you with a crash course on the essentials you should know for VPC as a developer.

## Key VPC Concepts Covered

Here's a quick look at what we’ll cover:

- **VPC Basics** – An isolated network in the AWS Cloud, where you can launch resources securely.
- **Subnets** – Logical subdivisions of the VPC that allow you to place resources in distinct network locations, either publicly accessible or private.
- **Internet Gateways and NAT Gateways** – Components that enable instances in a VPC to communicate with the internet, with NAT Gateways providing secure internet access to instances in private subnets.
- **Security Groups and Network ACLs (NACLs)** – Essential for controlling traffic in and out of resources within your VPC. Security Groups act as a firewall for individual instances, while NACLs control traffic at the subnet level.
- **VPC Flow Logs** – A logging tool that captures IP traffic data for your network interfaces within the VPC, which is helpful for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **VPC Peering and VPC Endpoints** – Methods for connecting VPCs securely within or across AWS accounts, enabling private communication without traversing the internet.
- **Site-to-Site VPN and Direct Connect** – Options for securely linking your on-premises network with your VPC.

These topics cover the essentials you’ll need to confidently address VPC-related questions in the exam. If you've already completed a VPC section in another AWS course, such as for [SysOps](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/) or [Solutions Architect](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/), feel free to skip ahead  or stay tuned for a helpful review!

## How This Post will help you

Throughout the course, we’ll revisit VPC concepts as they come up in different contexts. If you don’t remember everything right away, don’t worry; I’ll reintroduce key concepts when we encounter them in future sections.

Whether you’re new to VPC or looking to brush up, this section is designed to build your confidence. Let's dive in!

## Conclusion

Aws is a great cloud service provider. It is important to understand the basics of VPC to be able to use it effectively.
