  <h4> Question 1: Amazon RDS supports the following databases, EXCEPT: </h4><details><summary>MySQL</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>MongoDB</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> RDS supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, MS SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora.</p></details><details><summary>MariaDB</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Microsoft SQL Server</summary><p>False</p></details>

  <h4> Question 2: You're planning for a new solution that requires a MySQL database that must be available even in case of a disaster in one of the Availability Zones. What should you use? </h4><details><summary>Enable Encryption</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Create Read Replicas</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Enable Multi-AZ</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> Multi-AZ helps when you plan a disaster recovery for an entire AZ going down. If you plan against an entire AWS Region going down, you should use backups and replication across AWS Regions.</p></details>

  <h4> Question 3: We have an RDS database that struggles to keep up with the demand of requests from our website. Our million users mostly read news, and we don't post news very often. Which solution is NOT adapted to this problem? </h4><details><summary>RDS Multi-AZ</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> Be very careful with the way you read questions at the exam. Here, the question is asking which solution is NOT adapted to this problem. ElastiCache and RDS Read Replicas do indeed help with scaling reads.</p></details><details><summary>An ElastiCache Cluster</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>RDS Read Replicas</summary><p>False</p></details>

<h4> Question 4: Which RDS (NOT Aurora) feature when used does not require you to change the SQL connection string? </h4><details><summary>Read Replicas</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Multi-AZ</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> Multi-AZ keeps the same connection string regardless of which database is up.</p></details>

<h4> Question 5: You have set up read replicas on your RDS database, but users are complaining that upon updating their social media posts, they do not see their updated posts right away. What is a possible cause for this? </h4><details><summary>There must be a bug in your application</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>You should have setup Multi-AZ instead</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Read Replicas have Asynchronous Replication, therefore it's likely your users will only read Eventual Consistency</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> null</p></details>

<h4> Question 6: Your application running on a fleet of EC2 instances managed by an Auto Scaling Group behind an Application Load Balancer. Users have to constantly log back in and you don't want to enable Sticky Sessions on your ALB as you fear it will overload some EC2 instances. What should you do? </h4><details><summary>Use your own custom Load Balancer on EC2 instances instead of using ALB</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Store session data in RDS</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Store session data in ElastiCache</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> Storing Session Data in ElastiCache is a common pattern to ensuring different EC2 instances can retrieve your user's state if needed.</p></details><details><summary>Store session data in a shared EBS volume</summary><p>False</p></details>

<h4> Question 7: An analytics application is currently performing its queries against your main production RDS database. These queries run at any time of the day and slow down the RDS database which impacts your users' experience. What should you do to improve the users' experience? </h4><details><summary>Run the analytics queries at night</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Setup a Read Replica</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> Read Replicas will help as your analytics application can now perform queries against it, and these queries won't impact the main production RDS database.</p></details><details><summary>Setup Multi-AZ</summary><p>False</p></details>

<h4> Question 8: You are running an ElastiCache Redis cluster which you want to ensure it is high available. What should you do? </h4><details><summary>Add Read Replicas</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Enable Multi-AZ</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> null</p></details>

<h4> Question 9: Your company has a production Node.js application that is using RDS MySQL 5.6 as its database. A new application programmed in Java will perform some heavy analytics workload to create a dashboard on a regular hourly basis. What is the most cost-effective solution you can implement to minimize disruption for the main application? </h4><details><summary>Create a Read Replica in a different AZ and run the analytics workload on the replica database</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> null</p></details><details><summary>Create a Read Replica in a different AZ and run the analytics workload on the source database</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Enable Multi-AZ for the RDS database and run the analytics workload on the standby database</summary><p>False</p></details>

<h4> Question 10: You would like to create a disaster recovery strategy for your RDS PostgreSQL database so that in case of a regional outage the database can be quickly made available for both read and write workloads in another AWS Region. The DR database must be highly available. What do you recommend? </h4><details><summary>Create a Read Replica in the same region and enable Multi-AZ on the main database</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Create a Read Replica in the same region and enable Multi-AZ on the Read Replica</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Create a Read Replica in a different region and enable Multi-AZ on the Read Replica</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> A Read Replica in a different AWS Region than the source database can be used as a standby database and promoted to become the new production database in case of a regional disruption. So, we'll have a highly available (because of Multi-AZ) RDS DB Instance in the destination AWS Region with both read and write available.</p></details><details><summary>Enable Multi-Region option on the main database</summary><p>False</p></details>

<h4> Question 11: You have migrated the MySQL database from on-premises to RDS. You have a lot of applications and developers interacting with your database. Each developer has an IAM user in the company's AWS account. What is a suitable approach to give access to developers to the MySQL RDS DB instance instead of creating a DB user for each one? </h4><details><summary>Use Amazon Cognito</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>By default IAM users have access to your RDS database</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Enable IAM Database Authentication</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> null</p></details>

<h4> Question 12: Which of the following statement is true regarding replication in both RDS Read Replicas and Multi-AZ? </h4><details><summary>Read Replica uses Synchronous Replication and Multi-AZ uses Synchronous Replication</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Read Replica uses Asynchronous Replication and Multi-AZ uses Asynchronous Replication</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Read Replica uses Synchronous Replication and Multi-AZ uses Asynchronous Replication</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Read Replica uses Asynchronous Replication and Multi-AZ uses Synchronous Replication</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> null</p></details>

<h4> Question 13: How do you encrypt an unencrypted RDS DB instance? </h4><details><summary>Do it straight from AWS Console, select your RDS DB instance, choose Actions then Encrypt using KMS</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Create a snapshot of the unencrypted RDS DB instance, copy the snapshot and tick "Enable encryption", then restore the RDS DB instance from the encrypted snapshot</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> null</p></details><details><summary>Do it straight from AWS Console, after stopping the RDS DB instance</summary><p>False</p></details>

<h4> Question 14: For your RDS database, you can have up to ............ Read Replicas. </h4><details><summary>5</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>15</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> null</p></details><details><summary>7</summary><p>False</p></details>
