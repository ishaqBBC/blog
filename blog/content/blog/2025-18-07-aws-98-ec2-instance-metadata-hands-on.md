## TL;DR
- Launch a new EC2 [instance](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-03-17-aws-13-ssh/) using the **Amazon Linux 2023 AMI**.
- In the **Advanced Details**, note that **IMDSv2** is enforced by default.
- Complete the [instance](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-03-17-aws-13-ssh/) creation and connect using **EC2 Instance Connect**.
- To query [instance](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-03-17-aws-13-ssh/) metadata, you **must first retrieve a session token**.

Use the following commands to retrieve metadata via IMDSv2:

```sh
TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" \
  -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600") \
&& curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

## Introduction

Amazon EC2 provides a service called the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS), which allows EC2 [instances](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-03-17-aws-13-ssh/) to access data about themselves and their IAM roles. This is useful for scripts and applications running on the [instance](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-03-17-aws-13-ssh/) that need to adapt to their environment or make AWS API calls securely.

There are two versions of this service:

- **IMDSv1**: Simple HTTP request-based.
- **IMDSv2**: Adds a layer of security using session-based tokens.

By default, Amazon Linux 2023 supports **IMDSv2 only**, while Amazon Linux 2 allows a choice between IMDSv1 and IMDSv2.


## Setting Up the EC2 Instance

1. **Launch a new EC2 instance**.
   - AMI: Choose **Amazon Linux 2023**.
   - Metadata Options: Note that IMDSv2 is enforced by default. No option to enable IMDSv1.
   - Security Group: Allow SSH access from anywhere (for demonstration).
   - IAM Role: Start without a role; we’ll attach it later.

2. **Connect to the EC2 instance** using [**EC2 Instance Connect**](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-03-24-aws-14-instance-connect/).


## Verifying Metadata Access

### Step 1: Try IMDSv1 (Expected to Fail)

Try accessing metadata using IMDSv1:

```sh
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
````

**Result:**

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
```

This confirms that IMDSv1 is not enabled on Amazon Linux 2023.

---

## Using IMDSv2 Properly

### Step 2: Retrieve a Token

Before making metadata requests, generate a session token:

```sh
TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" \
  -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600")
```

You can check the token with:

```sh
echo $TOKEN
```

### Step 3: Access Metadata Using Token

Now use the token to make metadata requests:

```sh
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

You should now see metadata categories like:

```
ami-id
hostname
instance-id
local-ipv4/
security-groups
...
```

You can query specific values like so:

```sh
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname
```

Example output:

```
ip-172-31-xx-xx.ec2.internal
```


## Accessing IAM Role Credentials

Initially, there are no IAM credentials attached, so these paths will fail:

```sh
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/identity-credentials/ec2/security-credentials/
```

**Result:**

```json
Not Found
```

### Step 4: Attach an IAM Role

* In the EC2 console:

  * Go to your [instance](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-03-17-aws-13-ssh/) > Actions > Security > Modify IAM Role.
  * Attach any existing IAM role.

Wait \~30 seconds for the role to propagate.

### Step 5: Query IAM Role Credentials

Now try again:

```sh
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/identity-credentials/ec2/security-credentials/
```

This should return the role name. Then query the credentials:

```sh
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/identity-credentials/ec2/security-credentials/<role-name>
```

You’ll receive a JSON object with:

* AccessKeyId
* SecretAccessKey
* Token
* Expiration

These temporary credentials are rotated automatically and can be used by the AWS CLI or SDKs to authenticate API calls.


## Conclusion

Understanding how EC2 interacts with the Instance Metadata Service helps you appreciate the security mechanisms in place and how AWS simplifies credential management. IMDSv2 is the standard going forward, and it’s important to know how to interact with it, especially when debugging or building automation scripts.

The EC2 [instance](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-03-17-aws-13-ssh/) metadata service allows the [instance](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-03-17-aws-13-ssh/) to:

* Understand its environment (e.g., region, IP, hostname).
* Automatically retrieve IAM credentials when a role is attached.

When finished experimenting, remember to **terminate your EC2 instance** to avoid charges.
