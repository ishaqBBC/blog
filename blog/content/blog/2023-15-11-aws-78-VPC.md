## TLDR

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS is a private network within the AWS cloud, allowing secure deployment of resources. VPCs contain subnets, which can be public (internet-accessible) or private (more secure). Routing within a VPC is managed using [route tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html) Internet gateways provide internet access to public subnets, while [NAT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) (Network Address Translation) gateways allow private subnet instances to access the internet securely.

## Introduction to VPC and Subnets

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a private network within the AWS cloud that allows you to deploy your resources securely. Each VPC is a regional resource, meaning if you have two AWS regions, you will have two separate VPCs.

### VPC Structure

Inside a VPC, which is a logical construct, you have subnets. Subnets partition your network within the VPC and are defined at the availability zone (AZ) level. For example, in one AZ, you can have multiple subnets.

### Types of Subnets

1. **Public Subnet**: Accessible from the internet, allowing resources within it to communicate with the World Wide Web.
2. **Private Subnet**: Not accessible from the internet, providing a more secure environment for your resources.

### Routing in VPC

To manage access to the internet and between subnets, we use [route tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html) These tables define how network traffic flows between different subnets within your VPC.

### Example Scenario

Consider a VPC with the following setup:

- One region with a VPC containing a set of IP ranges (CIDR range).
- Two AZs, each with a public and a private subnet.
- EC2 instances deployed in both public and private subnets.

In this setup:

- EC2 instances in the public subnet have internet access.
- EC2 instances in the private subnet do not have direct internet access for enhanced security.

### Internet Gateways and NAT Gateways

#### Internet Gateway

An internet gateway allows instances in public subnets to connect to the internet. It resides within your VPC, and public subnets have a route to this gateway, enabling internet access.

#### NAT Gateway

For instances in private subnets that need internet access (e.g., for software updates) without being directly accessible from the internet, a [NAT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) gateway is used. The [NAT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) gateway is deployed in a public subnet and provides internet access to private subnet instances while keeping them secure.

### Wrapping Up

Getting a handle on VPCs and subnets is key to building secure and efficient setups on AWS. Public subnets let your resources reach the internet, while private subnets keep things locked down. Internet gateways and [NAT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) gateways are essential for managing how your network traffic flows and who gets access.
