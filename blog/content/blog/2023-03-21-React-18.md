## Introduction

Our codebase is currently being upgraded to React 18.
React 18 introduces several new features that improve performance and provide more granular control over server-side rendering
Today's post will give you a brief overview of some of these new features

## Concurrent features

Concurrent in old french means "acting in conjunction, contributing to the same effect or event, or happen at the same time" and in Latin translates to "to run together. Think of this word as a state of cooperation.

In the context of React, React 18 provides the use of concurrent rendering. And the things that can be "ran together" are the UIs. multiple UI can be prepared for render at the same time.

Concurrent rendering is not particular feature, its a mechanism for rendering that is interruptible. It does this by using techniques such as priority queues and multiple buffering. These are big words that go beyond the scope of this blog, and lucky for us, these will not be seen in public API offerings in React 18. Instead reacts wants us to think about what we need the end user to see, not the implementation details of the rendering,

While these features are not needed to be known in depth, understanding what react 18s rendering model is ; and that it's fundamentally different from previous iterations will help us understand some of the new features.

## Interruptible Rendering

Concurrent React is rendering thats interruptible. This means renders can be paused, stopped and continued later. React claims to still let the user see the final UI, it does this by making changes to the DOM tree after its evaluations. this means the UI will be consistent even if the renderer is interrupted. And we no longer need to wait for a render to be completed before moving on to another computation.

React can make UIs in the background, and therefore will not block the main thread.

With the use of concurrent renders, we can even display previous states of a UI, for example if the user is on another screen.

## Batched updates

In React 18, state updates are automatically batched together, but developers can opt out of batching for a particular update using flushSync.

Before batched updates where only available in react event handlers, now , even in promises, setTimeouts and native event handlers, all updates are batched. This means out of the box , react 18 gives us better performance.

```javascript
function click(event) {
  setFetching(true)
  setError(event)
  setFormStatus(true)
}
//Re-renders before React 18 = will be three
//Re-renders on React 18 = 1
```

Due to the core rendering system now being concurrent, these features will out of the box, and should not break existing code, However using `<StrictMode />` will display some errors during developer modes.

## How to migrate from 16 to 18

- import latest edition of React

```bash
    npm install react react-dom
```

- In the file where your react code gets rendered, change:

```javascript
// Before
import { render } from "react-dom"
const container = document.getElementById("app")
render(<App tab="home" />, container)
```

```javascript
// After
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client"
const container = document.getElementById("app")
const root = createRoot(container) // createRoot(container!) if you use TypeScript
root.render(<App tab="home" />)
```

- Now you should have access to the new concurrent features.

## New API features

startTransition to navigate between screens without blocking user input. Or useDeferredValue to throttle expensive re-renders.Suspense, transitions, and streaming server rendering.

### Suspense

React 18 also provides support for suspense in server-side rendering. Server-side rendering is a technique where the HTML of a component is rendered on the server and sent to the user to view while the JavaScript bundles are loading. With suspense, if one component loads slowly or needs to run a lot of JavaScript before becoming interactive, it no longer becomes a bottleneck for the app, and it won't slow down the entire app. Previously, server-side rendering was all or nothing, but now suspense provides a more granular approach to rendering.

Suspense on the server allows developers to show critical content first and have the rest of the HTML stream pop in as it becomes available. This feature works well with code splitting and can significantly improve the user experience.

```javascript
import {Suspense} from 'react'
...
<Suspense fallback={<DancingDots />}>
  <Component>
   //fetch requests
  </Component>
<Suspense>
```

### Transitions

distinguish between urgent and non-urgent updates.
Its a new concept. for events that not expected to be urgent.

```javascript
import {startTransition} from 'react'
 ...
//urgent
setInput(input)

//transitions - not as urgent
setTransition(() => {
  setSlider(input)
})

```

startTransition is to navigate between screens without blocking user input

now think of events in two ways, urgent . where we call state directly because the response must be urgent (input fields)

or a during a transition period, (such as an UI update)

Transitions are part of concurrent rendering and therefore can be interrupted , this means the urgent events will take priority, The concurrent render will resume meaning the user sees the latest state.

transitions can also be used as a hook with `useTransition`

### Demo

  <iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/react-16-playground-forked-rstx9g?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
       style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
       title="React 16 playground (forked)"
       allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
       sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
     ></iframe>
  Above is an example of the hook `useTransition` the `isPending` returned from the hook allows us to treat anything under the `startTransition` callback to be rendered last in the que<Spinner />`

Or `useDeferredValue` to throttle expensive re-renders.

## Conclusion

React 18 includes automatic batching for state updates, which reduces the number of component rerenders and improves performance. Additionally, React 18 provides support for suspense on the server, allowing developers to delay loading of slow components and show critical content first, improving the user experience. The update also introduces new APIs for application and library developers. These new features make React 18 a significant performance optimization for React apps.
