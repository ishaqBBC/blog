## Introduction 

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a popular cloud platform used by individuals and businesses around the world. One of the most fundamental offerings of AWS is Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). In this blog post, we will explore EC2 and create our first website on AWS.

## What Is An EC2 Made Up Of
EC2 is composed of several services that work together to provide a virtual server that can be rented from AWS. The first step is choosing the operating system, which can be Linux, Windows, or even Mac OS. Then, the user can choose the amount of CPU, RAM, and storage space needed, as well as the type of network to attach to the EC2 instance.

# EC2 instances
There are several instance types available in EC2, ranging from simple t2.micro to more advanced instances with multiple vCPUs and large amounts of memory. Users can choose the instance type that fits best for their application and can be rented on demand from AWS.

EC2 instance types refer to the different combinations of virtual CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity that are available for rent on AWS. By choosing the right instance type for your workload, you can optimize performance and cost efficiency.

There are many different EC2 instance types, each designed for different use cases. Here is a table outlining some of the most commonly used instance types:

### Table Of The Most Frequent EC2 instance Types

| Instance Type | [vCPU](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-optimize-cpu.html)  | Memory (GiB) | Storage      | Network Performance | Free Tier ? |
| ------------- | ------ | ------ | ------------ | ------------------- | ----------- | 
| t2.micro      | 1      | 1    | EBS only     | Low to moderate     | Yes         |
| t2.xlarge     | 4      | 16   | EBS only     | Moderate            | No          |
| c5d.4xlarge   | 16     | 32   | 400 NVMe SSD | Up to 10 Gbps       | No          |
| r5.16xlarge   | 64 | 512 | Varies       | 20 Gbps            | No          |
| m5.8xlarge    | 32 | 128 | Varies       | 10 Gbps             | No          |     

## Free Tier Types
The t2.micro instance is the most basic and affordable instance type, suitable for low-traffic websites, small applications, or development and testing purposes. On the other hand, the c5d.4xlarge instance is a high-performance compute-optimized instance with local NVMe SSD storage that is ideal for data processing, batch processing, and other compute-intensive workloads.

## Bootstrapping
Bootstrapping is a process that launches commands when the EC2 instance starts up. This can be used to automate tasks such as installing updates, downloading software, and other tasks that are typically performed at boot time. EC2 User Data is used to automate boot tasks, and any command that is included in the User Data script will have root user access.


## Hands on

To create our first website on AWS, we will use an EC2 t2.micro instance. This instance is part of the AWS free tier, which allows up to 750 hours per month of t2.micro usage. The hands-on part of this blog will walk you through the process of creating your first website on AWS using an EC2 instance.

## How to Create a EC2 instance

In this tutorial, we will be launching our first EC2 instance on Amazon Linux. An EC2 instance is essentially a virtual server, and we will be using the console to do this. We will explore the various parameters available when launching an EC2 instance and focus on the most important ones. Then, we will launch a web server directly on the EC2 instance using user data, which is a piece of code that is passed to the instance. Finally, we will learn how to start, stop, and terminate our instance.

First, we will go into the EC2 console and click on `instances` and then `launch instances`. We will add a name and tags, A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. 

Give our instance a name in the first box. 
 Next, we will choose a base image for our EC2 instance. This is the operating system of our instance, and we will use Amazon Linux 2, which is provided by AWS. We will choose the 64 bit x86 architecture and leave everything else pretty much as the defaults.

We will then choose an instance type. Instant types differ based on the number of CPUs they have, the amount of memory they have, and how much they cost. We will use a T2 micro, which is **free tier** eligible. If we wanted to compare instance types, we can click on the link and see all the types of instances available and how much memory they have.


We will need a key pair to log into our instance if we use the SSH utility to access it. We will create a new key pair with the name `EC2 Tutorial` and choose the RSA encrypted key pair type. We will download the key pair in the .pem format for Mac, Linux, or Windows 10. If we have Windows 7 or Windows 8, we can use the PPK format for PuTTY.

Next, we will go into network settings. For now, we will leave everything as is, and our instance will get a public IP. We will then connect to our instance using a security group attached to it, which will control the traffic from and to our instance. The first security group created will be called launch-wizard-1 and will allow SSH traffic from anywhere. We will also allow HTTP traffic from the internet since we will launch a web server on our EC2 instance.

Click on the advanced details tab > the inside the `user data` text area - paste in this shell script

```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
    # install httpd (Linux 2 version)
    yum update -y
    yum install -y httpd
    systemctl start httpd
    systemctl enable httpd
    echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>"> /var/www/html/index.html
```
This is a script that will only run once on our instance. it installs crucial Apache web servers and creates a simple web page.

Finally, we will configure the storage and launch our instance. We will use the default storage, which is a general-purpose SSD. Once our instance is launched, we will copy the public IP address, log in using SSH, and then run a web server on our EC2 instance. In the next blog post.

## Conclusion
Launching our first EC2 instance on Amazon Linux is easy with the console. We explored the various parameters available, and we focused on the most important ones. We learned how to launch a web server directly on our instance using user data and how to start, stop, and terminate our instance. With this knowledge, we can now launch more instances and explore the different features of AWS.
