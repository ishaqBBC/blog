## TLDR

Hand on with [ElastiCache](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-02-09-aws-53-ElastiCache/) walks you through creating a [Redis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redis)-type [ElastiCache](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-02-09-aws-53-ElastiCache/) on AWS. You'll learn to design your own cache, configure settings, and manage options like encryption, backups, and maintenance. The guide emphasizes cost considerations and provides insights into the AWS console. Also with instructions on how to delete the cache cluster.

## Guide

**1. Design Your Cache:**

- Choose to design your own cache for better understanding. (Search up ElastiCache in the AWS console)
