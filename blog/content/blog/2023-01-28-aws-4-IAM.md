## Recap

Following the previous blogs in the series.

- [AWS 1: BookClub Overview](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/aws/)
- [AWS 2: Getting Started](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-01-23-aws-2-getting-started/)
- [AWS 3: UI Guide and Walk through](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-01-27-aws-3-UI-guide-and-walkthrough)

In today blog we will go over IAM (Identity and Access Manager) 

## What Is IAM
AWS has different types of accounts that all stem from one **Root**
When you created your account following [lesson 2](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-01-23-aws-2-getting-started/) a **Root** account was created by default. Naturally we can't have big organisations sharing one account because of security and usage needs. For example; Say one developer uses a particular service while the operations department of a company uses a totally different service. These users belong to different "group". 

## Users
Each user is a separate account that stems from the **Root** they can be grouped together

## Groups
IAM (Identity and Access Manager) is a way to place users into their correct group. And allow access based on their group. See the image below

![Groups in action](/blog/src/images/groups.png)
There are some caveats to Groups: 
- A user can belong to multiple groups
- Groups cannot contain other groups
- A user does not need to belong to a group 

### Why Create Groups ?
We want the users to work together and share the same permissions. For example ; the Sales team can share access to particular features that the development team do not need. 
So in AWS, you apply a principle called the least privilege principle.
So you don't give more permissions than a user needs.


### How Groups And Users Get Their access

Groups and users are created using `policies`. A `policy` is a [JSON document](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) that sets the permissions of what they are allowed to do.
here is an example of a `policy`

    
   ```
        {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DeveloperAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["ec2:*", "s3:*", "rds:*"],
      "Resource": ["*"],
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:PrincipalArn": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:group/Developers"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Sid": "OperationsAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["lambda:*", "dynamodb:*", "iam:*"],
      "Resource": ["*"],
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:PrincipalArn": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:group/Operations"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}


   ```
Developer group will have access to ec2, s3, rds.
Operations group will have access to lambda, dynamodb and iam
