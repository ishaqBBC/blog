## Recap

Following the previous blogs in the series.

- [AWS 1: BookClub Overview](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/aws/)
- [AWS 2: Getting Started](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-01-23-aws-2-getting-started/)

In todays blog; IAM (Identity and Access Manager) 

## What Is IAM
AWS has different types of accounts that all stem from one **Root** account.
When you created your account following [lesson 2](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-01-23-aws-2-getting-started/) a **Root** account was created by default. Naturally we can't have big organisations sharing one account. Security and usage needs means we must limit the amount of access users have. For example; Say one developer uses a particular service while the operations department of a company uses a totally different service. These users belong to different "group". 

## Users
Each user is a separate account that stems from the **Root** they can be grouped together

## Groups
IAM (Identity and Access Manager) is a way to place users into their correct group. And allow access based on their group. See the image below

![Groups in action](/blog/src/images/groups.png)
There are some caveats to Groups: 
- A user can belong to multiple groups
- Groups cannot contain other groups
- A user does not need to belong to a group 

### Why Create Groups ?
We want the users to work together and share the same permissions. For example ; the Sales team can share access to particular features that the development team do not need. 
So in AWS, you apply a principle called the least privilege principle.
So you don't give more permissions than a user needs.


### How Groups And Users Get Their access

Groups and users are created using `policies`. A `policy` is a [JSON document](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) that sets the permissions of what they are allowed to do.
here is an example of a `policy`

    
   ```
        {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DeveloperAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["ec2:*", "s3:*", "rds:*"],
      "Resource": ["*"],
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:PrincipalArn": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:group/Developers"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Sid": "OperationsAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["lambda:*", "dynamodb:*", "iam:*"],
      "Resource": ["*"],
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:PrincipalArn": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:group/Operations"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}


   ```
Developer group will have access to ec2, s3, rds.
Operations group will have access to lambda, dynamodb and iam

### Creating Your First Group

To create an IAM user, we will give it a username, such as "ishaq", and select the credential type. In this case, we will enable the password type of credential and set a custom password. We will also select "Next: Permissions" and add the user to a group.

In this example, we will create a group called "admin" and attach the "AdministratorAccess" policy to it. This policy will allow any account within this group to be an administrator of your account. By adding the user to this group, they will inherit the permissions associated with it.

We will also add tags to the user for organisation and tracking purposes. For example, we will add the tag "Department: Engineering" to the user "ishaq".

After reviewing the user's details, we will create the user and download the .csv file containing the user's credentials. We can also email login instructions to a specific email address if the user is being created for someone else.

Once the user is created, we can navigate to the "User groups" section and see that the "ishaq" user is a member of the "admin" group. By clicking on the group, we can see that it has the "AdministratorAccess" policy attached to it, providing full admin access to any users within the group.

In conclusion, AWS IAM is a powerful tool that enables you to secure access to your AWS resources. By creating an IAM user, we can ensure that the root user is only used in emergency situations and that day-to-day tasks are handled by an administrator account. By adding the user to a group and attaching a policy to it, we can easily manage the permissions associated with the user. Additionally, by adding tags to the user, we can track and organize them for better management.
