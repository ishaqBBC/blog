## Introduction

With the EC2 Instance we created from [episode 10](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-24-aws-10-EC2/#instance) In todays blog, we will be going over how gain entry into your instance remotely, using the network protocol SSH.

SSH (Secure Shell) allows you to control a remote machine using a CLI (command line interface). This following blog post has been tested on **Mac devices**.

SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that allows secure remote access to a computer or server. It provides a way to encrypt the data transmitted between two devices and authenticate the identity of the remote computer.

SSH is used to connect to an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance. EC2 is a web service that provides resizable computing capacity in the cloud.

## Here are the instructions for SSH-ing into an EC2 instance: (On Mac)

- Download the PEM file called `EC2Tutorial.pem` and remove any spaces in the filename. **Creating this file was done in : [The EC2 Introduction](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-24-aws-10-EC2/#instance)**

- Place the PEM file in a directory of your choice, for example, a folder called `aws-course`.

- Go to the EC2 instance overview page and copy the public IPv4 address of the instance you want to SSH into. This will be used in the terminal.

- Check the security group of your instance and ensure that it has a rule for Port 22 (SSH port) from anywhere by 0.0.0.0/0.

- Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you placed the PEM file using the command "cd" followed by the directory name.
  Use the SSH command to connect to your instance using the command

  ```bash
  "ssh -i EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@<public_IP_address>".
  ```

  - `EC2Tutorial.pem` was the name of the file

- If you receive an authentication error, reference the PEM file by using the "-i" flag in the SSH command.
  Once connected to the instance, you can control it using the command line interface as if you were inside the machine.

## Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble with SSH, here are some common issues and troubleshooting steps:

- Connection timeout: This is often related to security groups or firewalls. Make sure your security group is properly configured and assigned to your EC2 instance.

- Still experiencing connection timeout issues: A corporate or personal firewall may be blocking the connection. Try using EC2 Instance Connect.

- SSH not working on Windows: If you see "ssh command not found," you may need to use Putty. Follow the instructions and use EC2 Instance Connect if needed.

- Connection refused: This means there is no SSH utility running on the instance. Try restarting the instance, or if that doesn't work, terminate and create a new one using Amazon Linux 2.

- Permission denied: This could mean you're using the wrong security key or user. Check your EC2 instance configuration and use the user ec2-user for Amazon Linux 2 instances.

- Nothing is working: Don't panic. Use EC2 Instance Connect and make sure you're using Amazon Linux 2.

- Unable to connect: This may be because the public IP of your instance has changed. Update your command or Putty configuration with the new public IP.

## Conclusion

Today we showed you how to SSH into your instance. This blog post is for Mac devices.
