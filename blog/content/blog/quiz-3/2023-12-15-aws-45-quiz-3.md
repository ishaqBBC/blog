    <h4> Question 1: Scaling an EC2 instance from r4.large to r4.4xlarge is called ..................... </h4><details><summary>Vertical Scalability</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> Nice Job.</p></details><details><summary>Horizontal Scalability</summary><p>False</p></details>
    <h4> Question 2: Running an application on an Auto Scaling Group that scales the number of EC2 instances in and out is called ..................... </h4><details><summary>Horizontal Scalability</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> Nice Job.</p></details><details><summary>Vertical Scalability</summary><p>False</p></details>
    <h4> Question 3: Elastic Load Balancers provide a ....................... </h4><details><summary>static IPv6 we can use in our application</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>static IPv4 we can use in our application</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>static DNS name we can use in our application</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> Only Network Load Balancer provides both static DNS name and static IP. While, Application Load Balancer provides a static DNS name but it does NOT provide a static IP. The reason being that AWS wants your Elastic Load Balancer to be accessible using a static endpoint, even if the underlying infrastructure that AWS manages changes.</p></details>
    <h4> Question 4: You are running a website on 10 EC2 instances fronted by an Elastic Load Balancer. Your users are complaining about the fact that the website always asks them to re-authenticate when they are moving between website pages. You are puzzled because it's working just fine on your machine and in the Dev environment with 1 EC2 instance. What could be the reason? </h4><details><summary>The EC2 instances log out users as they can't see their IP addresses, instead, they receive ELB IP addresses.</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>The Elastic Load Balancer does not have Sticky Sessions enabled</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> ELB Sticky Session feature ensures traffic for the same client is always redirected to the same target (e.g., EC2 instance). This helps that the client does not lose his session data.</p></details><details><summary>Your website must have an issue when hosted on multiple EC2 instances</summary><p>False</p></details>
    <h4> Question 5: You are using an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic to your website hosted on EC2 instances. It turns out that your website only sees traffic coming from private IPv4 addresses which are in fact your Application Load Balancer's IP addresses. What should you do to get the IP address of clients connected to your website? </h4><details><summary>Modify your website's backend to get the client IP address from X-Forwarded-For header</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> When using an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic to your EC2 instances, the IP address you'll receive requests from will be the ALB's private IP addresses. To get the client's IP address, ALB adds an additional header called X-Forwarded-For contains the client's IP address.</p></details><details><summary>Modify your website's backend to get the client IP address from X-Forwarded-Proto header</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Modify your website's frontend so that users send their IP in every request</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Modify your website's backend to get the client IP address from X-Forwarded-Port header</summary><p>False</p></details>
    <h4> Question 6: You hosted an application on a set of EC2 instances fronted by an Elastic Load Balancer. A week later, users begin complaining that sometimes the application just doesn't work. You investigate the issue and found that some EC2 instances crash from time to time. What should you do to protect users from connecting to the EC2 instances that are crashing? </h4><details><summary>Enable ELB Health Checks</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> When you enable ELB Health Checks, your ELB won't send traffic to unhealthy (crashed) EC2 instances.</p></details><details><summary>Enable ELB Stickiness</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Enable Cross-Zone Load Balancing</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Enable SSL Termination</summary><p>False</p></details>

Read more here: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-application-load-balancer-sni/</p></details><details><summary>Use a security group SSL certificate</summary><p>False</p></details>
    <h4> Question 16: You have an application hosted on a set of EC2 instances managed by an Auto Scaling Group that you configured both desired and maximum capacity to 3. Also, you have created a CloudWatch Alarm that is configured to scale out your ASG when CPU Utilization reaches 60%. Your application suddenly received huge traffic and is now running at 80% CPU Utilization. What will happen? </h4><details><summary>Nothing</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> The Auto Scaling Group can't go over the maximum capacity (you configured) during scale-out events.</p></details><details><summary>The desired capacity will go up to 4 and the maximum capacity will stay at 4</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>The desired capacity will go up to 4 and the maximum capacity will stay at 3</summary><p>False</p></details>

You need to create a CloudWatch Custom Metric, then create a CloudWatch Alarm.</p></details>
    <h4> Question 19: An application is deployed with an Application Load Balancer and an Auto Scaling Group. Currently, you manually scale the ASG and you would like to define a Scaling Policy that will ensure the average number of connections to your EC2 instances is around 1000. Which Scaling Policy should you use? </h4><details><summary>Target Tracking Policy</summary><p><span class="correct">Correct</span> Nice Job.</p></details><details><summary>Simple Scaling Policy</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Step Scaling Policy</summary><p>False</p></details><details><summary>Scheduled Scaling Policy</summary><p>False</p></details>
    <h4> Question 20: Your application hosted on EC2 instances managed by an Auto Scaling Group suddenly receives a spike in traffic which triggers your ASG to scale out and a new EC2 instance has been launched.
