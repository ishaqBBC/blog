Some really awesome new selectors have been added to the CSS spec in this blog article we will deep dive into each one.

## :Has()

A pseudo-class that is used to apply styles directly to the parent element. For example: lets say you want to apply styles to a `ul` element but only if it has **has** `li` elements as children. 

This can be achieved using the `:has()` pseudo-class


## :is()

## :Where()
