# TLDR

AWS RDS, or Relational Database Service . catering to databases using SQL. It supports various engines like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and Aurora. RDS automates database provisioning, OS patching, and offers benefits like continuous backups, point-in-time restores, monitoring dashboards, read replicas, multi-AZ setups, and scalable storage backed by EBS. Unlike deploying on [EC2](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-24-aws-10-EC2/), RDS doesn't allow SSH access, but its managed services outweigh this limitation. An exam-relevant feature is RDS storage auto scaling, automatically adjusting storage based on usage thresholds to avoid manual scaling operations.

# Introduction

Let's start with the basics. AWS RDS stands for Relational Database Service. In simpler terms, it's like having a super-smart helper that takes care of databases for you. These databases speak a language called SQL, which is a fancy way of asking questions to databases.

## The Gang of Database Engines

AWS RDS manages several types of databases. We've got:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
- [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/uk/database/)
- [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
- [Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/)

## Why RDS?

Why we'd choose RDS over setting up our own database? RDS is like having a magical genie. It not only gives you a database but also takes care of a ton of things. Imagine having someone set up your room, clean it, and make sure everything is just right â€“ that's RDS for databases.

## RDS Features

RDS isn't just a database. It automates setting up databases, does backups constantly, and even lets you travel back in time with something called **Point in Time Restore**. It's like having a superpower to undo mistakes!

You can also monitor your database's performance with cool dashboards, create copies of your database for extra speed (read replicas), and set up safety nets for emergencies (multi-AZ for disaster recovery).

## Storage

RDS uses something called **Elastic Block Store** [EBS](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-04-14-aws-16-EBS-Overview-and-Hands-On/) to store data. You can make this box bigger without lifting a finger, thanks to a feature called RDS Storage Auto Scaling.

## Storage Auto Scaling

If your database gets too busy, this feature automatically makes more room without bothering you.
To make sure it doesn't go wild and never stop growing, you set some rules. It won't grow unless it's really needed, and it follows some strict instructions you give it.

## Conclusion

AWS RDS provides a solution for relational databases, offering a range of benefits from automated provisioning to scalable storage. Its support for various database engines and features like auto scaling make it a powerful choice for organisations seeking efficient and reliable database management. While lacking direct access to underlying EC2 instances, the trade-off in terms of managed services and automation makes RDS a compelling option for those prioritizing ease of use and scalability in their database deployments
