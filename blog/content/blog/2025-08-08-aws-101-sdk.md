## TLDR
The AWS SDK (Software Development Kit) lets you interact with AWS services directly from your application code instead of using the CLI. It’s available in multiple languages like Python (Boto3), Java, Node.js, and more. The CLI itself uses the Python SDK. You’ll use SDKs for services like S3 and DynamoDB, especially in applications like AWS Lambda. If you don’t set a region, the SDK defaults to us-east-1, which is a common exam question for AWS certifications.


## Introduction

When working with Amazon Web Services (AWS), most newcomers start with the Command Line Interface (CLI). It’s straightforward and effective for issuing commands. But what happens when you want your application code itself to interact directly with AWS?

This is where the AWS SDK—Software Development Kit—comes into play.

## Whats an SDK? 

An SDK is essentially a collection of tools that allow your application to talk to AWS services through code. Rather than typing commands into a terminal, developers can programmatically issue API calls to AWS resources like S3, DynamoDB, and many others, directly from their application logic.

## Languages
AWS provides official SDKs for a wide range of programming languages. The current list includes:

[Java](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/)

[.NET](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/)

[Node.js](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-node-js/)

[PHP](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/)

[Python](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/)

[Go](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/)

[Ruby](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/)

[C++](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/)

This means no matter what language your application is written in, there’s likely an SDK that integrates seamlessly with AWS.

## Python and the CLI Connection
If you’ve used the AWS CLI, you’ve already been working under the hood with an SDK. The [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) is written in Python and uses the Boto3 SDK, AWS’s official Python SDK, to execute commands.

So, even when you're not explicitly writing Python code, the SDK is doing the heavy lifting in the background.

## When to Use an SDK
You’ll want to use an SDK when your application needs to interact with AWS services dynamically. For example:

A web app saving user files to Amazon S3

A serverless function reading from or writing to DynamoDB

Automating infrastructure tasks without using scripts or the CLI

You’ll encounter the SDK again when working with AWS Lambda. That’s where we’ll see it in practical use within code.

## Regions
By default, if you don’t set a [Region](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-01-23-aws-2-getting-started/) in your SDK configuration, us-east-1 will be selected. This default behaviour is important to know specially if you’re preparing for the AWS Developer Associate exam, where this detail may come up.

## Conclusion

The AWS SDK allows developers to interact with AWS services through code.

Official SDKs are available for many major programming languages.

The CLI you’ve been using? It runs on the Python SDK (Boto3).

You’ll see the SDK in action when working with services like Lambda and S3.

Don’t forget to specify a region—or you’ll end up in us-east-1 by default.

This high-level introduction sets the stage. There’s more to explore, and hands-on experience will help cement these concepts. Until then, consider this your foundation.
