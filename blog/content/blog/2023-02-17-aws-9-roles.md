## TLDR

This blog post introduces IAM Roles, the last component of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). IAM roles are used to grant permissions to AWS services to perform actions on your behalf, and they're specifically intended to be used by AWS services, not physical users. IAM roles are crucial to securing your AWS resources and services, and they allow you to grant temporary access to resources and services without having to share long-term credentials, such as access keys or passwords. The post also explains how to create a role for an EC2 instance and provides an overview of other AWS services that use IAM Roles. Overall, IAM Roles are an essential part of securing your AWS resources and services by granting the right level of access to each entity in your environment while minimising the risk of unauthorised access or misuse.

## Introduction

AWS IAM Roles: A Vital Part of Your AWS Identity and Access Management Strategy

As a developer, it's important to have a clear understanding of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to ensure that your resources and services are secure and accessible only by authorized users. In this post, we'll be diving into the last component of IAM, IAM Roles.

## What is a Role?

IAM Roles play a **crucial role in granting permissions to AWS services to perform actions on your behalf**. These roles are similar to IAM users but are specifically intended to be used by AWS services, not physical users. This allows you to assign permissions to AWS services so that they can perform actions on your account without having to access your AWS credentials.

Let's take a closer look at how IAM Roles work. Suppose you are launching an EC2 Instance, which is a virtual server, in your AWS account. Your EC2 Instance needs to perform actions on AWS and to do so, you need to provide it with the necessary permissions. To accomplish this, you'll create an IAM Role, which will be linked to the EC2 Instance. When the EC2 Instance tries to access information from AWS, it will use the IAM Role. If the IAM Role has the appropriate permissions, the EC2 Instance will be granted access to the call it is trying to make.

Other common examples of AWS services that use IAM Roles include Lambda Functions, CloudFormation, and more.

It's important to understand the concept of role assumption in AWS. When an IAM role is created, it doesn't have any credentials associated with it. Instead, the role is meant to be assumed by another entity, such as an EC2 instance or a Lambda function.

When an entity assumes a role, it is given temporary security credentials that allow it to access the resources and services specified in the role's policies. These credentials typically have a lifespan of an hour, after which they expire and the entity must request new credentials by assuming the role again.

Role assumption is an important security feature in AWS because it allows you to grant temporary access to resources and services without having to share long-term credentials, such as access keys or passwords. This helps to reduce the risk of unauthorised access or credential theft, as well as simplifying credential management.

Another important feature of IAM roles is the ability to use them in cross-account scenarios. By creating a role in one AWS account and granting access to it from another account, you can allow users and services in the second account to assume the role and access resources in the first account. This is a powerful way to manage access between multiple accounts and reduce the complexity of managing separate sets of IAM users and permissions in each account.

In addition to EC2 instances and Lambda functions, roles can also be used with other AWS services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, and Amazon Redshift. By using roles, you can give these services access to other AWS resources or to external resources that require authentication.

IAM roles are an essential part of securing your AWS resources and services. By carefully designing and assigning roles, you can grant the right level of access to each entity in your environment while minimising the risk of unauthorised access or misuse.

We'll be creating a Role first before we dive in Lambda's, EC2s and CloudFormations.

## How to Create a Role for a EC2 instance

In the IAM console, the sidebar contains the roles
![iam roles](/blog/src/images/iam-19.png)
Click on the `create role` button

The goal of this blog series to make us ready for the developer certificate exam, and while there are many trusted entity types, these are out of scope of this series. The only one that concerns is **AWS Service**.

![service entity types](/blog/src/images/iam-20.png)

select the `AWS Service` entity type radio button and also `EC2` radio button.

Next we need to attach a [Policy](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-03-aws-5-IAM-polices) for our roles.

![readonly iam](/blog/src/images/iam-21.png)

In the permissions policy search bar type in `iamreadonlyaccess` check this policy

Click on `Next` to continue

Now we need to give our role a name. in the picture below I used the name `ExampleRole` but you can use any naming convention you would like. I left the description as it's default
![role name](/blog/src/images/iam-22.png)

Fill in the fields, and review everything at the bottom of the page. Once you are happy, click `Create Role`

Congratulations, you have created your new role. To confirm- if you now go on the role section of the IAM console. the new role will be there.

Stay tuned for the next blog post, where we explore EC2, and show the connection to our roles.
