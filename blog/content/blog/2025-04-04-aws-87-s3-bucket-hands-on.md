title: "AWS 87: S3 Bucket Hands on"
date: 2025-04-04T09:51:28.457Z
---
## TLDR 
This guide walks through making an S3 bucket publicly accessible by:  
1. **Enabling Public Access** – Adjust bucket permissions to allow public access (with caution).  
2. **Configuring a Bucket Policy** – Use AWS Policy Generator to create a policy allowing `s3:GetObject` for all users.  
3. **Applying & Validating the Policy** – Save the policy and verify its correctness.  
4. **Accessing Public Files** – Retrieve the Object URL and check accessibility in a browser.  

⚠ **Security Warning:** Making an S3 bucket public can expose sensitive data. Always assess risks and consider alternatives like pre-signed URLs or IAM policies.
## Introduction

In this guide, we will walk through the process of setting up a public S3 bucket policy to allow access to a specific file via a public URL. While this can be useful, it is crucial to understand the security implications of making an [S3 bucket public](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2025-28-03-aws-86-s3-security-bucket-policy/). Ensuring that sensitive data is not exposed is of utmost importance. Let's proceed with caution.

### **Step 1: Enable Public Access in Bucket Settings**

1. Navigate to the **Permissions** tab of your S3 bucket.
2. By default, all access is blocked. To allow public access, edit the settings and uncheck the option that blocks all public access.
3. Confirm that you understand the risks before proceeding.

> **Warning:** This step should only be done if you are certain that you want to make the bucket publicly accessible. Exposing sensitive data can lead to security breaches.

### **Step 2: Configure the Bucket Policy**

1. Scroll down to the **Bucket Policy** section.
2. If no policy is set, click **Create Policy**.
3. AWS provides policy examples and documentation, but for this guide, we will use the **AWS Policy Generator**.
4. Open the **AWS Policy Generator** and create an **S3 Bucket Policy**.
5. Set the following configurations:
   - **Effect:** Allow
   - **Principal:** * (This allows access from any source)
   - **Action:** s3:GetObject (Allows objects to be read from the bucket)
   - **Resource:** The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your bucket, followed by `/*` to apply to all objects in the bucket.

### **Step 3: Apply and Validate the Policy**

1. Copy the generated policy and paste it into the **Bucket Policy Editor**.
2. Save the changes.
3. Verify that the policy has been applied correctly.

### **Step 4: Access the Public File**

1. Navigate to the **Objects** section of the bucket and find the file you wish to access.
2. Copy the **Object URL**.
3. Open the URL in a browser. If everything is set up correctly, the image or file should be publicly visible.

### **Final Thoughts**

We have successfully configured a public S3 bucket policy using AWS Policy Generator. While making a bucket public is sometimes necessary, always be cautious about the data being exposed. For sensitive or confidential information, consider alternative access control methods, such as pre-signed URLs or IAM policies.
