## TLDR

Hands on in creating an Amazon Aurora Database , this will occur charges.

## Introduction:

Following from th previous [post of Amazon Aurora](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-01-12-aws-49-Amazon-Aurora/) - this time we'll have a hands on.
Amazon Aurora is a powerful and scalable relational database offered by AWS however its **NOT FREE**
Charges will be occurred by making an Aurora database, but just keep in mind - its good to be familiar with the steps

## How to create a database

- In the AWS console type in RDS > Databases > Create Database
- Start by selecting the "Create Database" option. You'll be prompted to choose between two Aurora options: MySQL-compatible and PostgreSQL-compatible. For this hands-on guide, we'll go with the MySQL-compatible option.

## Version and Template Selection

Scroll down to the version selector and choose the default version proposed by the Aurora console. Next, select the "Production" template for a fully configurable setup. Specify a unique DB cluster identifier, set the master username (e.g., admin), and create a password.

## Cluster Storage Configuration and Instance Selection

Opt for Aurora standard or IO optimized based on your workload. Choose an instance type that suits your needs; for instance, we'll use db.t3 medium in this guide. If you're using a version compatible with serverless, you'll see the Serverless v2 option, allowing automatic scaling between minimum and maximum capacity units.

## Availability and Durability Settings

Configure Aurora replicas for enhanced availability and better read performance. Decide on the network type (IPv4 or dual-stack mode for IPv6). Set up a VPC and create a new security group for access. Enable public access if needed.

## Additional Configuration

Fine-tune additional settings like database port, local write forwarding, authentication mechanisms, monitoring, and encryption. Specify the initial database name, backup retention, and other optional features according to your requirements.

## Review and Create

Creating the database will incur charges, so from this point - you can exit
Review your configurations and be mindful of the **monthly costs displayed**. Once satisfied, proceed to create your Aurora database.

## Explore Aurora Features

After creation, explore the features like read and write endpoints, regional clusters, cross-region read replicas, and auto-scaling options to optimize your database performance.

## Clean Up

Once you've completed your hands-on experience, remember to delete your Aurora database. Start by deleting any read replicas, followed by the writer instance. Finally, delete the entire cluster.

Conclusion:
Congratulations! You've successfully created and explored the capabilities of an Amazon Aurora database. This versatile and scalable solution offers a range of features, including global databases and serverless options. Always be mindful of costs and remember to clean up after your hands-on exploration. If you have any questions or want to learn more about AWS services, stay tuned for future blog posts. Happy cloud computing!
