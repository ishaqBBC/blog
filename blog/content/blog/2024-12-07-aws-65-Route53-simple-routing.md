## TLDR

AWS Route 53 routing policies are designed to respond to DNS queries rather than routing traffic. DNS translates host names to IP addresses without directing traffic. Route 53 supports several policies: Simple, Weighted, Failover, Latency-based, Geolocation, Multi-value Answer, and Geoproximity. The Simple Routing Policy directs traffic to a single resource, returning one or more IP addresses. Setting up this policy involves creating a record in the AWS console and verifying it with the dig command. This policy allows client-side load balancing by randomly selecting an IP address from multiple options. Understanding this policy can be helpful for AWS exam preparation.

## Understanding Routing Policies in AWS Route 53

When preparing for the AWS exam, understanding the concept of routing policies in Route 53 is essential. It's important to note that the term "routing" in this context differs from how it's used with load balancers. Instead of routing traffic to backend instances, Route 53 routing policies help respond to DNS queries.

### What is DNS Routing?

DNS (Domain Name System) does not route traffic directly; it merely responds to DNS queries. When a client makes a request, the DNS translates the host name into an endpoint (like an IP address) that the client can then use to make HTTP queries. The traffic itself does not go through the DNS. [FInd out more](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-03-12-aws-58-DNS-name/)

### Types of Routing Policies

AWS Route 53 supports several routing policies:

- **Simple**
- **Weighted**
- **Failover**
- **Latency-based**
- **Geolocation**
- **Multi-value Answer**
- **Geoproximity**

Each type has its unique functionality and use case. Let's dive into the simplest one, the Simple Routing Policy.

### Simple Routing Policy

The Simple Routing Policy is straightforward and typically directs traffic to a single resource. Here’s how it works:

1. A client requests access to a domain, e.g., `foo.example.com`.
2. Route 53 responds with an IP address associated with that domain.
3. This response is an A record, which can contain multiple IP addresses.

If multiple IP addresses are specified, the client will randomly choose one of them. For example, if `foo.example.com` returns three IP addresses, the client selects one randomly for its HTTP query.

### Creating a Simple Routing Policy

Let’s go through the steps to create a Simple Routing Policy in the AWS console:

1. **Create a Record:**

   - Record Name: `simple.example.com`
   - Record Type: A (Address Record)
   - Value: IP address of your instance, e.g., in `ap-southeast-1`
   - TTL (Time to Live): 20 seconds
   - Routing Policy: Simple

2. **Verify the Record:**
   [use cloud shell](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-05-03-aws-61-Route53-Creating-First-Record/) and install `dig` first

   - Use the `dig` command to query the DNS and verify the A record:
     ```sh
     dig simple.example.com
     ```
   - You should see the IP address returned with a TTL of 20 seconds.

3. **Update the Record with Multiple IPs:**

   - Edit the existing record to include multiple IP addresses (e.g., one in `ap-southeast-1` and one in `us-east-1`).
   - Save the record and wait for the TTL to expire.

4. **Verify Multiple IP Responses:**
   - Use the `dig` command again:
     ```sh
     dig simple.example.com
     ```
   - You should now see multiple IP addresses in the response.

### Client-Side Load Balancing

With multiple IP addresses, the client randomly chooses one for its query. For example, refreshing the page may alternate between instances in different regions (`ap-southeast-1` and `us-east-1`), demonstrating how the Simple Routing Policy operates.

### Conclusion

The Simple Routing Policy in AWS Route 53 is easy to set up and demonstrates basic DNS functionality. Remember, it doesn't provide health checks or sophisticated traffic management, but it’s a fundamental building block for understanding more advanced policies. Practice creating and managing these records in the AWS console to get hands-on experience, which will be invaluable for your AWS exam preparation.
