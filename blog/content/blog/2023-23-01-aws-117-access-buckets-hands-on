## Practising Amazon S3 Access Logs: A Simple Walkthrough

## TLDR

* Create a separate S3 bucket to store access logs
* Turn on *Server access logging* for an existing bucket
* Choose the logging bucket as the destination
* Activity in your bucket is recorded, but logs take time to appear
* Log files show who accessed the bucket, when, and what they did


Amazon S3 access logs help you understand what is happening inside your storage buckets. They record every request made to a bucket, such as uploading a file or opening an object. In this short guide, we’ll walk through how to set them up and what to expect afterwards.

### Step 1: Create a Logging Bucket

The first step is to create a new S3 bucket. This bucket will store the access logs.

Think of it like a notebook. Instead of keeping notes inside the main bucket, Amazon S3 writes them into a separate one. This keeps things tidy and easier to manage.

Once the bucket is created, leave it open in one browser tab.

### Step 2: Enable Access Logging on Another Bucket

In a second tab, open one of your existing S3 buckets. This can be any bucket you like.

* Go to **Properties**
* Scroll down to **Server access logging**
* Click **Edit** and enable logging

Amazon S3 will let you know that it needs to update the bucket policy. This is important, as it allows S3 to write log files to your logging bucket.

### Step 3: Choose Where the Logs Go

Now you must tell Amazon S3 where to send the logs.

* Select the logging bucket you created earlier
* Confirm the region (for example, *eu-west-1*)
* Leave the prefix empty unless you want logs stored in a folder
* Keep the default log file format

For most users, the default settings work just fine. Click **Save changes** when you’re done.

Your bucket is now being logged.

### Step 4: Create Some Activity

To test this, try doing something in your bucket:

* Upload a file
* Open an object
* Download an image

Every action you take creates activity, and that activity will be recorded.

If you refresh the logging bucket straight away, you may see nothing. That’s normal.

### Step 5: Be Patient and Check Permissions

Access logs are not delivered instantly. They are sent in batches, which can take minutes or even hours.

While waiting, you can check that everything is set up correctly:

* Open the logging bucket
* Go to **Permissions**
* Look at the **Bucket policy**

You should see a policy that allows the Amazon S3 logging service to write objects to the bucket. This confirms that logging is working as expected.

### Step 6: Reviewing the Logs

After some time, refresh the logging bucket again.

You should now see many new files. These are your access logs. Open one, and you’ll see detailed information such as:

* The API call that was made
* Whether it succeeded or failed
* Who accessed the bucket
* Which bucket was used
* The exact time of the request

The data can look complicated at first, but it is very useful for security checks and troubleshooting.

### Final Thoughts

S3 access logs are a powerful tool, but they require patience. Once enabled, they quietly record activity in the background and deliver detailed records later.

That’s all for S3 access logs. Thanks for reading, and see you in the next lesson.
