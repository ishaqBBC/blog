## What is a Design Pattern

Design patterns are concepts that we can use to solve or at least improve commonly recurring issues in software architecture. It's important to note that these patterns aren't a checklist to make your app performant, but rather a way to raise awareness of common problems that might negatively impact the performance of your app. In the future, if you run into an issue with your software architecture, you may be able to use a design pattern to solve the problem.

## Module Patterns in JavaScript: Encapsulating Your Code

JavaScript has evolved significantly over the years, and one of the key changes that has taken place is the way in which developers write and organize their code. In the past, it was common to have one large file that contained all of the methods and values that were needed. However, with the advent of the module pattern, developers are now able to split their code up into smaller, reusable pieces that can be easily managed and organized.

The module pattern allows developers to export values from a module so that they can be imported and used in other files. This is achieved by using the export keyword, which makes the values accessible to other modules. Additionally, any values that are not explicitly exported are private to the module, which means that they can only be used within that module. This makes it possible to encapsulate values within a module and prevent them from being used elsewhere in the application.

There are two ways in which modules can be used in JavaScript: in HTML by using the `type="module"` attribute on a script tag, or in Node by using the mjs file extension or by adding the `"type" : "module"` attribute in the package.json file. When using the `"type" : "module"` attribute, everything in the module is encapsulated and cannot be accessed from other parts of the application. However, if the module is imported and the values are exported, they can be used in other parts of the application.

The benefits of using the module pattern are numerous. By encapsulating values within a module, it is easier to maintain privacy and prevent sensitive data from being used elsewhere in the application. Additionally, the module pattern makes it easier to reuse code, as developers can create a module and then import it in multiple places. This eliminates the need to repeat code and makes it easier to manage and maintain the application.
