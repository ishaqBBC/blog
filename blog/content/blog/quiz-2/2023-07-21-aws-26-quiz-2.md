      <h4>
        Question 1. You have just terminated an EC2 instance in us-east-1a, and its
        attached EBS volume is now available. Your teammate tries to attach it
        to an EC2 instance in us-east-1b but he can't. What is a possible cause
        for this?
      </h4>
      <details>
        <summary>"He's missing IAM permissions",</summary>
        <p>False</p>

        <summary>EBS volumes are locked to an Availability Zone</summary>
        <p>
          <span class="correct">Correct! </span> EBS Volumes are created for a specific AZ. It is possible to
          migrate them between different AZs using EBS Snapshots.

      <h4>
        Question 2: You have launched an EC2 instance with two EBS volumes, the
        Root volume type and the other EBS volume type to store the data. A
        month later you are planning to terminate the EC2 instance. What's the
        default behavior that will happen to each EBS volume?
      </h4>
      <details>
        <summary>
          The root volume type will not be deleted and the EBS volume type will
          be deleted,
        </summary>
        <p>
          <span class="correct">Correct! </span> By default, the Root volume type will be deleted as its
          Delete On Termination attribute is checked by default. Any other EBS
          volume types will not be deleted as its Delete On Termination
          attribute is disabled by default.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>

  <h4>
    Question 3: You can use an AMI in N.Virginia Region us-east-1 to launch an
    EC2 instance in any AWS Region.
  </h4>
  <details>
    <summary>True?</summary>
    <p>False</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>False?</summary>
    <p>
      <span class="correct">Correct! </span> AMIs are built for a specific AWS Region, they're unique for each
      AWS Region. You can't launch an EC2 instance using an AMI in another AWS
      Region, but you can copy the AMI to the target AWS Region and then use it
      to create your EC2 instances.

  <h4>
    Question 4: Which of the following EBS volume types can be used as boot
    volumes when you create EC2 instances?
  </h4>
  <details>
    <summary>gp2, gp3, io1, io2</summary>
    <p>
      <span class="correct">Correct! </span> When creating EC2 instances, you can only use the following EBS
      volume types as boot volumes: gp2, gp3, io1, io2, and Magnetic (Standard).

  </h4>
  <details>

    Question 8: You would like to have a high-performance local cache for your
    application hosted on an EC2 instance. You don't mind losing the cache upon
    the termination of your EC2 instance. Which storage mechanism do you
    recommend as a Solutions Architect? [ "Instance Store", "EBS", "EFS" ]

  <h4>
    Question 9: You are running a high-performance database that requires an
    IOPS of 310,000 for its underlying storage. What do you recommend?
  </h4>
  <details>
    <summary>Use an EC2 Instance Store</summary>
    <p>
      <span class="correct">Correct! </span> You can run a database on an EC2 instance that uses an Instance
      Store, but you'll have a problem that the data will be lost if the EC2
      instance is stopped (it can be restarted without problems). One solution
      is that you can set up a replication mechanism on another EC2 instance
      with an Instance Store to have a standby copy. Another solution is to set
      up backup mechanisms for your data. It's all up to you how you want to set
      up your architecture to validate your requirements. In this use case, it's
      around IOPS, so we have to choose an EC2 Instance Store.
