## TLDR

Learn how to set up EC2 instances in multiple regions and configure an [Application Load Balancer (ALB)](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/ApplicationLoadBalancer/2023-08-18-aws-29-applicaton-load-balancer/) using [Route 53](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-04-19-aws-Route53-overview/). Follow step-by-step instructions for launching [instances](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-03-03-aws-11-EC2-View-and-instance-types), configuring [security groups](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-03-10-aws-12-security-groups/), creating user data scripts, setting up the ALB, and testing the setup for seamless functionality.

### Setting Up EC2 Instances

First things first, let's get started with creating our [instances](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-03-03-aws-11-EC2-View-and-instance-types). We'll be launching instances in three different [regions](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-01-23-aws-2-getting-started/#regions) - one in Frankfurt, one in Northern Virginia, and one in Singapore. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Choosing Instance Configuration**: We opt for Amazon Linux2 on a T2 micro type of instance.

2. **Security Group Configuration**: Allow SSH and HTTP from anywhere to ensure accessibility.

3. **User Data Script**: Incorporate a bootstrap user data script for advanced configuration, enhancing our instance with additional information such as the availability zone. below is an example:

```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
    # install httpd (Linux 2 version)
    yum update -y
    yum install -y httpd
    systemctl start httpd
    systemctl enable httpd
    echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f) in $EC2_AVAIL_ZONE </h1> "> /var/www/html/index.html
```

### Configuring the Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Once our instances are up and running, we proceed to set up the [ALB](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/ApplicationLoadBalancer/2023-08-18-aws-29-applicaton-load-balancer/) in Frankfurt. Here's a glimpse into the setup process:

1. **Creating the Load Balancer**: We select an application load balancer (ABL), configure it to be internet-facing, and map subnets accordingly.

2. **Security Group Configuration**: Ensuring that HTTP is enabled by selecting the appropriate [security group](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-03-10-aws-12-security-groups/).

3. **Target Group Creation**: We create a target group based on instances, register the instances, and review the targets.

### Verifying Setup and Testing

With everything configured, it's time to ensure that our setup is working seamlessly. We test each EC2 instance individually by accessing them via their public IPs. Additionally, we check the ALB's [DNS name](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-03-12-aws-58-DNS-name/) to confirm its provisioning.

Keep a note of the IPs and DNS name of the ALB.

### Conclusion

And there you have it! By following these steps, you've successfully set up EC2 instances across multiple regions and configured an ALB using Route 53. This setup ensures high availability and load balancing, essential for robust and scalable applications.
