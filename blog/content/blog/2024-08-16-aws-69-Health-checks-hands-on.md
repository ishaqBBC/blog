## TLDR

Following our previous [post](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-09-08-aws-68-Route-53-Health-checks/) This is a hands on, for how to create a health check for your instances. In addition how to make a health check to check a group of health checks for alarms.

## Introduction

Monitoring the health of your infrastructure is needed to ensure [high availability](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/section6/2023-07-28-high_availability_and_scalability/) and performance. In this guide, we'll walk through creating health checks for [EC2 instances](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-24-aws-10-EC2/) using Amazon [Route 53](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-04-19-aws-Route53-overview/). This process will allow you to monitor the status of your instances and take action if any become unhealthy.

### Step 1: Accessing Health Checks in Route 53

Start by navigating to the [Route 53](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-04-19-aws-Route53-overview/) dashboard in the AWS Management Console. On the left-hand side, locate and select **Health Checks**. Here, we will create health checks for each of our EC2 instances across different regions.

### Step 2: Creating Your First Health Check

1. **Select an Instance**: Choose an instance, for example, one in the US East (N. Virginia) region.
2. **Set the Endpoint**: Specify the endpoint using the IP address of your instance.
3. **Configure Basic Settings**:
   - **Port**: Set this to `80` for HTTP.
   - **Path**: Use `/`, which represents the root of your website. If your application has a specific health-check path like `/health`, you would enter that here.

### Step 3: Advanced Configuration

Next, you can customise the health check:

- **Interval**: Choose between a standard 30-second interval or a faster 10-second interval (which is more expensive).
- **Failure Threshold**: Determine how many consecutive failures are needed before the instance is considered unhealthy.
- **String Matching**: Optionally, look for specific strings in the response body.
- **Latency Graph**: Enable this to track latency over time.
- **Health Status Inversion**: This option reverses the health status, marking an unhealthy instance as healthy, and vice versa.
- **Region Selection**: Use the recommended health checker regions or customise as needed.
- **Notifications**: You can set up an alarm to notify you of any health check failures.

For now, we'll keep these settings as default and move forward.

### Step 4: Creating Additional Health Checks

Repeat the process to create health checks for your other instances, such as:

- **AP Southeast (Singapore)**: Specify the IP address and complete the setup.
- **EU Central (Frankfurt)**: Follow the same steps to create this health check.

### Step 5: Testing Health Checks by Inducing a Failure

To simulate a failure, we can block port 80 on one of the instances, such as the one in Singapore:

1. Go to the **Security Groups** of the instance.
2. Edit the **Inbound Rules** and remove the HTTP rule (port 80).
3. Wait a moment for the health check to detect the failure.

You should see that the health check for the Singapore instance turns unhealthy, confirming the setup is working correctly.

### Step 6: Creating a Calculated Health Check

A calculated health check allows you to monitor the status of multiple health checks:

1. Create a new health check and select **Calculated**.
2. Define the logic, such as marking it as healthy only when all monitored health checks are healthy.
3. Finalise the setup.

### Step 7: Linking Health Checks with CloudWatch Alarms

Lastly, you can create a health check linked to a [CloudWatch alarm](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) . This is particularly useful for monitoring private resources:

1. Specify the region where the alarm is configured.
2. Link it to the desired [CloudWatch alarm](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) .

Currently, we won't proceed with this step as no alarms are set up, but this is a powerful feature for comprehensive monitoring.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you've successfully created health checks for your EC2 instances in Route 53. These checks will help you maintain the reliability of your services, providing insights into the health of your infrastructure.
