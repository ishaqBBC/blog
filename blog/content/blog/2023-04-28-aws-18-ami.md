## TLDR
Todays blog is about Amazon Machine Image (AMI), which is a customised version of an EC2 instance that includes the software configuration, the operating system, and any monitoring tool required to launch the instance. It explains the importance of creating an AMI and its benefits such as faster boot time and configuration time.

## Introduction

In todays blog post we will be going over **Amazon Machine Image**
One of the most popular cloud computing services on AWS is Elastic Compute Cloud [EC2](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-24-aws-10-EC2/). It allows account members to launch virtual servers and manage them as per their requirements. One of the key elements that powers EC2 instances is **Amazon Machine Image**(AMI).

## What is Amazon Machine Image (AMI)?

In simple terms, an AMI is a customised version of an EC2 instance. It includes the software configuration, the operating system, and any monitoring tool required to launch the instance. account members can create their own AMIs or use the ones provided by AWS.

## Why is AMI important for AWS EC2 Instances?

Creating an AMI allows account members to ensure faster boot time and configuration time because all the software that they want to install onto their EC2 instance is prepackaged through the AMI. AMI creation and maintenance is a task that account members have to do themselves, but automation tools are available to simplify the process.

## How does AMI work?

To build an AMI, account members have to start an EC2 instance and customise it as per their requirements. Once the instance is customised, it has to be stopped to ensure data integrity. account members can then build an AMI from it, which also creates EBS [snapshots](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-04-21-aws-17-ebs-snapshots)behind the scenes. This custom AMI can be launched from any other [Regions](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-01-23-aws-2-getting-started/) as well.

## Types of AMIs

Account members can launch EC2 instances from different kinds of AMIs. AWS provides public AMIs like Amazon Linux 2, which are popular and widely used. account members can also launch instances from AWS Marketplace AMIs, which are made by vendors and sold on the AWS marketplace. These AMIs come with pre-configured software, saving account members time and effort.

| Type of AMI          | Description                                                                         | Source                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Public AMIs          | AMIs provided by AWS, such as Amazon Linux 2, widely used and popular               | AWS                     |
| AWS Marketplace AMIs | AMIs made by vendors and sold on AWS marketplace, come with pre-configured software | AWS Marketplace vendors |

## Conclusion

Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is an essential tool that allows account members to customise their EC2 instances as per their requirements. By creating their own AMIs, account members can ensure faster boot time and configuration time. AWS provides public AMIs and vendors sell their own AMIs on the AWS marketplace. AMI creation and maintenance is a task that account members have to do themselves, but automation tools are available to simplify the process. In next weeks blog post we will go hands on with AMI.
