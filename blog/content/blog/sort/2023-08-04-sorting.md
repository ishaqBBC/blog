## TLDR

We go over two basic sorting algorithms and how they can be used in javascript.

Bubble Sort: Imagine you're fixing your cards one pair at a time. If two cards are in the wrong order, you swap them. Keep doing this until you can't swap anymore. The smaller cards 'bubble up' until the whole stack is sorted!

Merge Sort: Here, you divide your cards into smaller groups and sort them. Then, you cleverly merge them back together, making sure they're all in order. It's like sorting your cards by splitting them into tiny groups, then combining them.

## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are an important part of computer science, and they are used in many applications. Sorting algorithms are used to put a list of numbers into numerical order, and there are many different algorithms that can be used to accomplish this task. In this blog post, we will go over two basic sorting algorithms: bubble sort and merge sort.

## Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through a list of numbers to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list as they are sorted.

To understand how bubble sort works, imagine you have a list of playing cards that you want to sort. To sort the cards, you would start at the beginning of the list and compare each pair of cards in turn. If the two cards are in the wrong order, you would swap them. You would then move on to the next pair of cards and repeat the process until you reach the end of the list. Once you have gone through the list one full time and there are no more swaps to be made, you know the list is sorted.

### Code Example

```javascript
/**
 * opBubbleSort
 * @param n - array
 * @returns - array
 */
function bubbleSort(n) {
  let counter = 0
  do {
    for (let i = 0; i - n.length; i++) {
      if (n[i] > n[i + 1]) {
        let temp = n[i]
        n[i] = n[i + 1]
        n[i + 1] = temp
      }
    }
    counter++
  } while (counter < n.length)
  return n
}
```

the `n[i] > n[i + 1]` checks if the the next array position adjacent, if the `n[i]` is greater then following `temp` variable is used to swap those positions.

The for loop will pass through the array once, however the surrounding `while` will allow a through internal loop until all items are in place. this means the worst case scenario is looping thorough every combination: its n^2 . in big O notation this would be written as:

```math
O(n^{2})
```

### Optimized Bubble Sort

We can create a variable called `swapped` that is set to `true` when a swap occurs, if the swap happens we break out of the loop earlier and there reduce the amount of time needed to complete the sort.

```javascript
/**
 * opBubbleSort
 * @param n - array
 * @returns - array
 */
function opBubbleSort(n) {
  let counter = 0
  let swapped = false //optimised variable
  do {
    for (let i = 0; i - n.length; i++) {
      if (n[i] > n[i + 1]) {
        let temp = n[i]
        n[i] = n[i + 1]
        n[i + 1] = temp
        swapped = true
      }
    }
    counter++
    if (swapped) {
      break //will stop the do loop
    }
  } while (counter < n.length)
  return n
}
```

## Merge Sort

Merge sort is another basic sorting algorithm that works by dividing a list of numbers into smaller sub-lists, sorting those sub-lists, and then merging them back together. The algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sorting.

To understand how merge sort works, imagine you have a list of playing cards that you want to sort. To sort the cards, you would first divide the list into two equal-sized sub-lists. You would then recursively divide each sub-list into smaller sub-lists until each sub-list contains only one card.

You would then merge the sub-lists back together in pairs, sorting them as you go. Once all of the pairs have been merged, you would merge the resulting sub-lists back together, again sorting as you go. This process would continue until you have merged all of the sub-lists back together into a single sorted list.

```javascript
/*
 * @ param n - array
 * @ returns sorted array
 */
const sort = n => {
  if (n.length <= 1) return n //if array had length less than 1, return the array

  const middle = Math.floor(n.length / 2) //gets the middle of the array
  const left = n.slice(0, middle) //left side of the array
  const right = n.slice(middle) //right side of the array

  return merge(sort(left), sort(right))
}
/*
 * @param left - array
 * @param right - array
 * @returns - array
 */
const merge = (left, right) => {
  const result = []

  while (left.length && right.length) {
    //loops through
    if (left[0] <= right[0]) {
      // if the first element on left hand side is less than or equal to right hand side
      result.push(left.shift()) //adds the first element of left to the results array
    } else {
      result.push(right.shift()) //otherwise adds the first element of right to results array
    }
  }

  return [...result, ...left, ...right]
}
```

## Conclusion

Sorting algorithms are an essential tool for computer scientists, and there are many different algorithms that can be used to sort a list of numbers. In this blog post, we covered two basic sorting algorithms: bubble sort and merge sort. These algorithms are relatively simple and easy to understand, making them an excellent starting point for anyone interested in learning more about sorting algorithms. Whether you're sorting a list of playing cards or a spreadsheet full of data, knowing how to use these algorithms can save you time and effort.
