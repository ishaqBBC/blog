## TLDR
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature that controls how resources can be requested from different origins. It ensures that a website can only access data from 
another origin if explicitly allowed. This blog explains the concept of origins, the importance of CORS, 
the preflight request process, and its relevance to Amazon S3. 
Configuring CORS rules on S3 buckets is essential for enabling cross-origin requests, 
especially in scenarios involving static websites hosted on S3. Proper configuration ensures seamless asset loading while maintaining security.

# Introduction

[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing), known as CORS, is a security feature built into every modern web browser. It controls when a website is allowed to request data from another website. You only need to answer one question on this topic in the [AWS Certified Developer – Associate Exam](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/).

## What do we mean by origin?

An **origin** is made up of three parts:  
* the scheme or protocol such as HTTP or HTTPS  
* the host or domain name  
* the port number

For example, when you visit https://www.example.com, the protocol is HTTPS and the default port is 443. The domain is www.example.com. All of these together form the origin.

**Two URLs have the same origin only if all three parts match. If even one part is different, they have different origins.**

## Why does CORS matter?

CORS is a security rule inside your browser. It decides whether one website is allowed to request data from another website. If you visit www.example.com and the page tries to load something from other.example.com, the browser will check whether other.example.com has allowed this kind of request.

It does this by looking at special response headers. The most important one is Access Control Allow Origin. The other website must list the origin it allows. If it does not allow the origin, the browser blocks the request.

## How the pre flight process works

When your browser needs to request something from another origin, it often sends a preflight request first. This is an [HTTP OPTIONS request](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP#Request_methods) sent to the second website. It says something like, "I want to make a request, and my origin is https://www.example.com. Are you willing to allow this?"

If the second website is set up correctly, it replies with headers that list which origins and which methods are allowed. If the browser is satisfied with the reply, it continues and sends the real request to fetch the file. If the reply is not acceptable, the browser blocks the request before it even reaches the page.

## How this applies to Amazon S3

CORS comes up often in AWS exams, especially when you work with static websites hosted on S3. If your web page in one [S3 bucket](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2025-04-04-aws-87-s3-bucket-hands-on/) tries to fetch images or other assets stored in another bucket, the second bucket must allow the request.

To do that, you must configure CORS rules on the bucket that holds the assets. You can allow a specific origin or use a star to allow all origins. This is common in simple demo setups but should be used with care in real projects.

## A simple example

Imagine you have one [S3 bucket](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2025-04-04-aws-87-s3-bucket-hands-on/) hosting your main site. This site includes an image stored in a second S3 bucket. When the browser loads the main page, it tries to fetch the image from the second bucket. It sends the request along with the origin of the first site.

If the second bucket has no CORS rules or the rules do not allow the first bucket, the browser blocks the request and the image does not load. If the rules allow the origin, the browser loads the image without a problem. Below is a diagram

## Conclusion

CORS is not an AWS feature but a browser feature. It protects users by checking whether one website is allowed to request data from another. When using S3 static websites, remember to set your CORS rules correctly so that assets can load across buckets when needed. The next blog post will explain how to do this.
