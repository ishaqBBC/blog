## TLDR

AWS Route 53's **Multi-Value Routing Policy** helps route traffic to multiple resources by returning up to eight healthy IP addresses in response to DNS queries. It integrates with **Health Checks**, ensuring only healthy endpoints are returned, making it more reliable than the **Simple Routing Policy**, which doesn't check the health of resources.

Multi-Value Routing provides **client-side load balancing**, distributing traffic across multiple servers, but it’s not a replacement for full load balancers like ELB. It’s ideal for applications that need high availability across multiple regions.

## Introduction

AWS Route 53 is a scalable and highly available [Domain Name System (DNS) web service](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-03-12-aws-58-DNS-name/). Among its various features is the **Multi-Value Routing Policy**, a useful tool when you want to route traffic to multiple resources, such as multiple servers, and ensure that traffic is directed to healthy ones. In this post, we’ll break down the key elements of this policy and explain how it works.

## What is Multi-Value Routing?

Multi-Value Routing allows you to configure [DNS](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-03-12-aws-58-DNS-name/) to return multiple [IP](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address&ved=2ahUKEwi9hankt_SIAxXJWEEAHd96GIMQFnoECAgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3okv0waZV7YJprEg1ucd-a) addresses (or other resources) for a single domain. The system will provide up to eight values in response to DNS queries, but more importantly, it will only return healthy records—those passing associated **Health Checks**. This helps improve the reliability of your service by directing traffic away from unhealthy resources.

However, it's essential to note that **Multi-Value Routing is not a replacement for traditional load balancers like [Elastic Load Balancer](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/ElasticLoadBalancing/2023-08-12-aws-28-ELB/) (ELB)**. Instead, it acts as a form of client-side load balancing, where the client decides which resource to use from the provided list of healthy records.

## Setting Up Multi-Value Routing

Let’s consider an example where you want to set up Multi-Value Routing for a domain, such as `magicishaq.com`, with servers located in different geographical regions. We will set up three **A Records**, each corresponding to a server in a different AWS region. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### 1. Create the First Record

- **Name**: multi.example.com (or similar)
- **Value**: The IP address associated with the server in the `us-east-1` region.
- **Routing Policy**: Multi-Value.
- **Health Check**: Associated with the `us-east-1` region.
- **TTL** (Time to Live): 60 seconds.

### 2. Create the Second Record

- **Name**: multi.example.com (same domain name).
- **Value**: IP address associated with a server in `ap-southeast-1`.
- **Routing Policy**: Multi-Value.
- **Health Check**: Associated with `ap-southeast-1`.
- **TTL**: 60 seconds.

### 3. Create the Third Record

- **Name**: multi.example.com.
- **Value**: IP address for a server in `eu-central-1`.
- **Routing Policy**: Multi-Value.
- **Health Check**: For `eu-central-1`.
- **TTL**: 60 seconds.

## Testing the Configuration

Once the records are created, it’s time to test. Using a tool like **CloudShell**, you can query your DNS records using the `dig` command. For example, if you issue a DNS query for `multi.example.com`, you should receive up to three IP addresses (since there are three servers), as long as the health checks for all three regions are successful.

- If you manually mark one of the [health checks](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-09-08-aws-68-Route-53-Health-checks/) as **Unhealthy**, such as the one in `eu-central-1`, reissuing the query will return only the two healthy IP addresses (those in `us-east-1` and `ap-southeast-1`). This confirms that Multi-Value Routing successfully filters out unhealthy resources.

## Why Use Multi-Value Routing?

Compared to the **[Simple Routing Policy](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-12-07-aws-65-Route53-simple-routing/)**, which does not support [Health Checks](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-09-08-aws-68-Route-53-Health-checks/), Multi-Value Routing is much more reliable when uptime and performance are critical. Simple Routing can return IP addresses even for unhealthy resources, which may result in downtime or poor service. By using Health Checks, Multi-Value Routing ensures that clients only receive healthy and responsive endpoints.

### Key Benefits of Multi-Value Routing:

- **Client-side Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic among multiple healthy servers.
- **Health Check Integration**: Only returns healthy records, enhancing reliability.
- **Global Reach**: Suitable for applications with resources spread across multiple regions.
- **Flexibility**: Can be used alongside other routing policies depending on your needs.

## Conclusion

AWS Route 53’s Multi-Value Routing Policy is an effective way to ensure reliable routing for applications that span multiple resources or geographical regions. It guarantees that traffic is directed to healthy resources, improving both the uptime and performance of your service. While not a substitute for a full-fledged load balancer, this method offers a lightweight and flexible approach to managing DNS traffic efficiently.

Whether you're managing web servers across the globe or simply looking to ensure that your users are always directed to healthy endpoints, Multi-Value Routing is a powerful tool worth exploring.
