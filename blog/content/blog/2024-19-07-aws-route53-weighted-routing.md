## Introduction

In today's post, we delve into the weighted routing policy within [Amazon Route 53](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-04-19-aws-Route53-overview/). This policy allows you to control the distribution of DNS requests across multiple resources by assigning weights. This flexibility can be particularly useful for various purposes such as load balancing, regional distribution, or testing new application versions.

### How Weighted Routing Works

Weighted routing involves assigning a weight to each resource (such as EC2 instances). These weights dictate the proportion of traffic directed to each resource. For example, consider the following setup:

- **Resource 1:** Weight 70
- **Resource 2:** Weight 20
- **Resource 3:** Weight 10

These weights sum up to 100, but in practice, they don't have to. The traffic distribution is based on the relative weights of the resources. Here, Resource 1 will receive 70% of the traffic, Resource 2 will receive 20%, and Resource 3 will receive 10%.

### Implementing Weighted Routing in Route 53

To implement a weighted routing policy, follow these steps:

1. **Create DNS Records:** Each resource you want to route traffic to needs its own DNS record. For instance, if you're routing to three EC2 instances, create three records. [FIND OUT MORE HERE](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-03-12-aws-58-DNS-name/)
2. **Assign Weights:** Assign a weight to each record. The traffic percentage directed to each resource is calculated by dividing the weight of the resource by the total sum of weights.

3. **Configure TTL (Time to Live):** Although the TTL can be set to any value, for demonstration purposes, you might set it to a low value like three seconds to observe changes quickly. In production, a higher TTL is typically used.

### Example Setup

Let's walk through a practical example using three EC2 instances in different regions:

1. **Record for ap-southeast-1:**

   - **Name:** weighted.magicishaq.com
   - **Type:** A
   - **Value:** [IP address of ap-southeast-1 instance]
   - **Weight:** 10
   - **TTL:** 3 seconds

2. **Record for us-east-1:**

   - **Name:** weighted.magicishaq.com
   - **Type:** A
   - **Value:** [IP address of us-east-1 instance]
   - **Weight:** 70
   - **TTL:** 3 seconds

3. **Record for eu-central-1:**
   - **Name:** weighted.magicishaq.com
   - **Type:** A
   - **Value:** [IP address of eu-central-1 instance]
   - **Weight:** 20
   - **TTL:** 3 seconds

### Testing the Setup

After configuring the records, you can test the setup by accessing the URL `weighted.magicishaq.com`. Initially, you should see responses from the us-east-1 instance (due to its higher weight). However, over time and with multiple refreshes, you will observe responses from the other instances as well, demonstrating the weighted distribution.

Using the `dig` command, you can verify the DNS responses:

```sh
dig weighted.magicishaq.com
```

This command will show the IP address of the instance that responded, aligning with the weights assigned.

### Use Cases for Weighted Routing

Weighted routing is versatile and can be used for various scenarios:

- **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic among multiple servers to balance the load.
- **Regional Distribution:** Direct traffic based on the geographical location of resources.
- **Testing New Versions:** Gradually direct a small percentage of traffic to a new application version to monitor its performance before a full rollout.

### Conclusion

Weighted routing in Amazon Route 53 offers powerful control over traffic distribution to your resources. By assigning weights, you can efficiently manage load, test new applications, and handle regional traffic distribution. This functionality ensures that you can maintain optimal performance and reliability for your applications.
