1.) Regions :  Choose a Region that is geographically closer to you, in order to avoid latency. Each Region has an Availability zone 
 - 2.) Services : Here are all the AWS services that are available. Some are global; meaning every service has access, while others are region specific.
 - 3.) Search Bar: Much like Amazons e-commerce search bar. Here you can search for other services.
 - 4.) Guides: Tutorials and pathways to achieving a certificate 
 - 5.) Recently Visited : Shows the last services visited
