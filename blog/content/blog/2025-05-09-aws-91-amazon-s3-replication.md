title: "AWS 91: Amazon S3 Replication"

## TLDR

Amazon S3 Replication comes in two types    Cross-Region Replication (CRR) and Same-Region Replication (SRR). CRR helps copy data between buckets in different AWS regions, while SRR handles replication within the same region. Both require versioning and appropriate IAM permissions to function. Use cases include compliance, latency improvements, cross-account data sharing, and log aggregation.

Amazon S3 is a powerful and widely used [object storage service](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2025-03-14-aws-84-Amazon-s3/) provided by [AWS](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/aws/). Among its features, **S3 Replication** stands out as a way to **automatically copy objects** between S3 buckets    either across regions or within the same one.

## Two Types of Replication

There are **two "flavours" of S3 Replication**:

- **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**
  Replicates data from a source bucket in one AWS region to a destination bucket in a _different_ region.

- **Same-Region Replication (SRR)**
  Replicates data between buckets located within the _same_ AWS region.

## How It Works

S3 Replication is **asynchronous**, meaning the copy process runs in the background and may not happen instantly. Here are the key steps and requirements to set it up:

1. **Enable Versioning** on both the source and destination buckets. This is a strict prerequisite.
2. **Set proper IAM permissions**, allowing the S3 service to read from the source and write to the target bucket.
3. Buckets involved in replication can be in **the same or different AWS accounts**    giving flexibility for complex architectures.

## Use Cases

Here’s when you might choose one over the other:

### Cross-Region Replication (CRR)

- Ensures **data compliance** across jurisdictions.
- Reduces **latency** by positioning data closer to users in other regions.
- Facilitates **cross-account** or cross-region backup strategies.

### Same-Region Replication (SRR)

- Ideal for **log aggregation** across several buckets.
- Supports **real-time mirroring** between environments    such as production and test accounts    within the same region.
- Enables internal backup without leaving your chosen AWS region.

## Conclusion

Amazon S3 Replication is a reliable way to **automate the duplication of data** across or within regions, aligning with your data sovereignty, disaster recovery, or testing strategies. With the right configurations in place, it's a set-and-forget system that enhances data availability and resilience.

Looking to try it out? Make sure you understand how [S3 Versioning](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2025-05-02-aws-90-S3-versioning/) and [IAM policies](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-03-aws-5-IAM-polices/) work first, as these are key to a successful replication setup.
