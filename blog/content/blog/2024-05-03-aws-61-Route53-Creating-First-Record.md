title: "AWS 61: Route 53 Creating First Record"
date: 2024-05-0T13:17:25.674Z
---

## TLDR

This tutorial walks through creating [Route 53](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-04-19-aws-Route53-overview/) records in the hosted zone, specifying record names and types like an [A record](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html), setting TTL, and understanding routing policies. It demonstrates querying records using commands like [NS lookup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nslookup) or [dig](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_(command)>), installing necessary tools like [bind-utils](https://github.com/tigeli/bind-utils), and verifying record values. Though accessing via web browser won't work until linked to a real server [EC2](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-02-24-aws-10-EC2/), querying via [command line](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-01-27-aws-3-UI-guide-and-walkthrough/) provides insight into record resolution.

## Introduction

Following our [previous blog](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-04-19-aws-Route53-overview/) Route 53 records provide information about a domain including what IP address is associated with that domain and how to handle requests for that domain.

## How to Create Records

To create records, navigate to the hosted zone and click on the option to add a record. Enter the desired record name, such as `test.magishaq.com`, and specify the record type as an A record, which routes an IPv4 address to a domain name. For now, use a random value like `11.22.33.44` as the answer.

Leave the TTL (time to live) as 300 seconds and keep the routing policy simple. Click to create the record.

Now, when querying the record using tools like NS lookup or dig, you'll receive the corresponding IP address, indicating a successful record creation. While accessing via web browser won't work until linked to a real server, querying via command line provides insight into record resolution.

## AWS CloudShell

Navigate to [Cloudshell](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-01-27-aws-3-UI-guide-and-walkthrough/)
![Screen shot of record](/blog/src/images/61/61-2.png)

Ensure necessary command line tools like NS lookup or dig are installed. On AWS CloudShell, use `sudo yum install -y bind-utils` to install them. Then, query the record using NS lookup:

the AWS cloudshell will not have the tools needed to run the command so install them using this line:

```console
$ aws route53 create-hosted-zone --name test.stephanetheteacher.com
```

```console
$ nslookup test.stephanetheteacher.com
```

Or using **dig**:

```console
$ dig test.stephanetheteacher.com
```

Both commands will display the record details, including TTL and the A record value.

here is a sample respone you should see:

```bash
Server:         8.8.8.8
Address:        8.8.8.8#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   test.magicishaq.com
Address: 11.22.33.44
```

Once connected to a real server (will will do this in the next blog), accessing the URL via a web browser will work as expected. This concludes the tutorial on creating Route 53 records.
