## TLDR
Create Instances, create security groups, create ALB and configure all to distribute traffic among your EC2 instances. 

## Introduction
We will be having a hands on look on how to create an [**Application Load Balancer**](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/ApplicationLoadBalancer/2023-08-18-aws-29-applicaton-load-balancer/)


## Launch EC2 Instances:
1. **Creating your Instance**   
    - Go to your AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
   - Click on "Launch Instances" to create two EC2 instances.

2. **Configure EC2 Instances:**
   - In the instance launch wizard, select "Amazon Linux 2" as the Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
   - Choose the instance type as "t2.micro."
   - Skip the key pair selection since SSH access isn't needed.
   - For network settings, select the existing security group "Launch Wizard 1" that allows HTTP and SSH traffic.

3. **Add EC2 User Data:**
   - In advanced details, scroll down and find the user data section.
   ![advanced details](/blog/src/images/30/alb3.png)
   - Copy and paste the provided EC2 user data script below to configure instances.
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
    # Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
    # install httpd (Linux 2 version)
    yum update -y
    yum install -y httpd
    systemctl start httpd
    systemctl enable httpd
    echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>"> /var/www/html/index.html
   ```
   - Launch both instances with these settings.

4. **Rename Instances:**
   - Once instances are running, go to the EC2 Dashboard.
   - Rename the instances: "My First Instance" and "My Second Instance."
   ![renaming instances](/blog/src/images/30/6.png)

5. **Access Instances:**
   - Copy the IPv4 address of the first instance.
   - Paste it in a browser to verify you get a "hello world" message. use the protocol `http` NOT `https`
   - Repeat for the second instance.

## Application Load Balancer

6. **Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB):**
   - In the EC2 Dashboard, scroll down to "Load Balancers" and click "Create Load Balancer."
   ![alb](/blog/src/images/30/8.png)
   - Choose "Application Load Balancer."
   - Name your ALB (e.g., "DemoALB").
   ![alb name](/blog/src/images/30/9.png)
   - Select "Internet-facing" and choose "IPv4" as the address type.
   - For availability zones, deploy the ALB in all available zones.

7. **Configure Security Group for ALB:**
   ![security groups](/blog/src/images/30/10.png)
   - Create a new security group for the ALB (e.g., "demo-sg-load-balancer"). [refresher on security groups](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-03-10-aws-12-security-groups)
   - Configure inbound rules to allow HTTP traffic from anywhere.
   ![http traffic](/blog/src/images/30/11.png)
   ![create security group](/blog/src/images/30/13.png)

8. **Configure Listener and Target Group:**
   - Under listeners and routing, configure a listener for port 80 (HTTP).
   ![inbound rules](/blog/src/images/30/12.png)
   - Create a new target group (e.g., "demo-tg-alb") for HTTP on port 80.
    ![target group](/blog/src/images/30/15.png)
   - Configure health checks for the target group.

9. **Register Targets:**
   - Register both EC2 instances with the created target group on port 80.
   ![register](/blog/src/images/30/16.png)
    ![target groups](/blog/src/images/30/17.png)

10. **Complete ALB Setup:**
    - Once registered, go back to the ALB configuration page.
    - Your ALB should now be provisioned and active.
    - Find the DNS name associated with the ALB and copy it.
11. **Test Load Balancing:**
    - Paste the ALB's DNS name in a browser.
![dns name](/blog/src/images/30/alb20.png)
    - Refresh the page multiple times to observe load balancing between instances.
    - Verify that the ALB is distributing traffic between instances.

12. **Testing Unhealthy Instances:**
    - In the EC2 Dashboard, stop one of the instances.
    - Wait for the instance to become unhealthy in the target group.
    - Refresh the ALB's DNS name to observe load balancing with only the healthy instance.
    - Restart the stopped instance and verify it becomes healthy again in the target group.

Congratulations! You've successfully created an Application Load Balancer and configured it to distribute traffic among your EC2 instances. This setup provides improved availability and scalability for your blog application.

## Clean up
Instances cost money when they run, so please remember to terminate all instance to avoid extra costs.
