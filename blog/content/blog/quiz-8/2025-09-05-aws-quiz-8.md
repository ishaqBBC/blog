  <h4>Question 1:  An application hosted on an EC2 instance wants to upload objects to an S3 bucket using the PutObject API call, but it lacks the required permissions. What should you do? </h4> <details>
   <summary>From inside the EC2 instance, run aws configure and insert your personal IAM Credentials, because you have access to do the required API call</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Ask an administrator to attach an IAM Policy to the IAM Role on your EC2 instance that authorizes it to do the required API callCorrectIAM Roles are the right way to provide credentials and permissions to an EC2 instance.Explain this further</summary>
   <p><span class="correct">Correct</span>you correctly identified that IAM Roles are designed to securely provision permissions to EC2 instances, allowing them to interact with AWS services like S3 without hardcoding sensitive credentials. This approach aligns with best practices for managing permissions and enhances the security of your application.</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Export the environment variables with your IAM credentials on the EC2 instance</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Use the EC2 Metadata API call</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details>
<h4>Question 2:  You and your colleague are working on an application that's interacting with some AWS services through making API calls. Your colleague can run the application on his machine without issues, while you get API Authorization Exceptions. What should you do? </h4> <details>
   <summary>Send him your AWS Access Key and Secret Access Key so he can replicate the issue on his machine</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Ask him to send you his IAM credentials so you can work without issues</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Compare both your IAM Policy and him IAM Policy in AWS Policy Simulator to understand the differencesCorrectExplain this further</summary>
   <p><span class="correct">Correct</span></p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Ask him to create an EC2 instance and insert his IAM credentials inside it, so you can run the application from the EC2 instance</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details>
<h4>Question 3:  Your administrator launched a Linux EC2 instance and gives you the EC2 Key Pair so you can SSH into it. After getting into the EC2 instance, you want to get the EC2 instance ID. What is the best way to do this? </h4> <details>
   <summary>Create an IAM Role and attach it to your EC2 instance so you can perform a describe-instances API call</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Query the user data at http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Query the metadata at http://254.169.254.169/latest/meta-data</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Query the metadata at http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-dataCorrectExplain this further</summary>
   <p><span class="correct">Correct</span></p>
</details>
<h4>Question 4:  AWS CLI requires .......................... as its runtime. </h4> <details>
   <summary>Java</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Golang</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>PythonCorrectExplain this further</summary>
   <p><span class="correct">Correct</span></p>
</details><details>
   <summary>C#</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details>
<h4>Question 5:  You're running an application on an on-premises server. The application needs to perform API calls to an S3 bucket. How can you achieve this in the most secure manner? </h4> <details>
   <summary>Create an IAM user to be used by the application, then generate IAM credentials and put the credentials into environment variablesCorrectHere, it's about creating a dedicated IAM user for the application, as using your own personal IAM credentials would blur the lines between actual users and applications. Or, you can run aws configure on the on-premises server.Explain this further</summary>
   <p><span class="correct">Correct</span></p>
</details><details>
   <summary>From inside your on-premises server, run aws configure and insert your personal IAM Credentials</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Create an IAM user to be used by the application, then generate IAM credentials and use the credentials in the application's code</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Attach an IAM role to your on-premises server</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details>
<h4>Question 6:  When you have an IAM role attached to your EC2 instance and you run AWS CLI commands from inside this instance, AWS CLI uses the .......................... to get .......................... credentials. </h4> <details>
   <summary>Instance user data, temporary</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Instance Metadata, temporaryCorrectExplain this further</summary>
   <p><span class="correct">Correct</span></p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Instance user data, permanent</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Instance Metadata, permanent</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details>
<h4>Question 7:  When an IAM role is attached to your EC2 instance, you can retrieve both the IAM role name and the IAM policies attached to the role. </h4> <details>
   <summary>FalseCorrectYou can retrieve the IAM role name attached to your EC2 instance using the Instance Metadata service, but you can not retrieve the IAM policies themselves.Explain this further</summary>
   <p><span class="correct">Correct</span></p>
</details><details>
   <summary>True</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details>
<h4>Question 8:  The last API calls you made to AWS KMS begin to throttle, as you have reached the max. allowed API calls per second. What should you do? </h4> <details>
   <summary>Make API calls every 10 ms</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Use Exponential Backoff StrategyCorrectExplain this further</summary>
   <p><span class="correct">Correct</span> Using an Exponential Backoff Strategy is correct because it gradually increases the wait time between retries after a throttling event, reducing the chances of overwhelming the API and allowing it to recover effectively. This approach is essential for maintaining smooth interactions with APIs, especially when facing rate limits.</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Use Linear Backoff Strategy</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details>
<h4>Question 9:  Before making API calls against MFA-protected API, you should use ............................... to get temporary credentials. </h4> <details>
   <summary>STS GetSessionToken CorrectExplain this further</summary>
   <p><span class="correct">Correct</span> You chose "STS GetSessionToken" because it is the correct method for obtaining temporary credentials when making API calls that require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This demonstrates your understanding of managing secure access to AWS resources using the appropriate security tokens.</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>STS GetFederationToken </summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>IAM GetMFAToken</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details>
<h4>Question 10:  AWS CLI uses credentials located in multiple locations and certain locations take precedence over others. Which of the following is the correct order for locations AWS CLI uses to find credentials? </h4> <details>
   <summary>Environment Variables   > Command-Line Options   > EC2 Instance Profile</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Command-Line Options   > Environment Variables   > EC2 Instance ProfileCorrecthttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html#config-settings-and-precedenceExplain this further</summary>
   <p><span class="correct">Correct</span> "Command-Line Options   > Environment Variables   > EC2 Instance Profile" because this order correctly represents the precedence AWS CLI uses to find credentials, where command-line options take the highest priority, followed by environment variables, and lastly the EC2 instance profile. Understanding this hierarchy is important for effectively managing credential access in AWS.</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>EC2 Instance Profile   > Command-Line Options   > Environment Variables</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>EC2 Instance Profile   > Environment Variables   > Command-Line Options</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details>
<h4>Question 11:  AWS CLI and AWS SDKs sign API requests for you using your AWS access key. If you're writing your custom code, you must sign AWS API requests using ......................... </h4> <details>
   <summary>Signature Version 1 (SigV1)</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Signature Version 2 (SigV2)</summary>
