<h4>Question 5:  You're running an application on an on-premises server. The application needs to perform API calls to an S3 bucket. How can you achieve this in the most secure manner? </h4> <details>
   <summary>Create an IAM user to be used by the application, then generate IAM credentials and put the credentials into environment variablesCorrectHere, it's about creating a dedicated IAM user for the application, as using your own personal IAM credentials would blur the lines between actual users and applications. Or, you can run aws configure on the on-premises server.Explain this further</summary>
   <p><span class="correct">Correct</span></p>
</details><details>
   <summary>From inside your on-premises server, run aws configure and insert your personal IAM Credentials</summary>
   <p>False</p>

</details>
<h4>Question 7:  When an IAM role is attached to your EC2 instance, you can retrieve both the IAM role name and the IAM policies attached to the role. </h4> <details>
   <summary>FalseCorrectYou can retrieve the IAM role name attached to your EC2 instance using the Instance Metadata service, but you can not retrieve the IAM policies themselves.Explain this further</summary>
   <p><span class="correct">Correct</span></p>
</details><details>
   <summary>True</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details>
<h4>Question 8:  The last API calls you made to AWS KMS begin to throttle, as you have reached the max. allowed API calls per second. What should you do? </h4> <details>
   <summary>Make API calls every 10 ms</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>Use Exponential Backoff StrategyCorrectExplain this further</summary>
   <p><span class="correct">Correct</span> Using an Exponential Backoff Strategy is correct because it gradually increases the wait time between retries after a throttling event, reducing the chances of overwhelming the API and allowing it to recover effectively.

   <p><span class="correct">Correct</span> "Command-Line Options —> Environment Variables —> EC2 Instance Profile" because this order correctly represents the precedence AWS CLI uses to find credentials, where command-line options take the highest priority, followed by environment variables, and lastly the EC2 instance profile. Understanding this hierarchy is important for effectively managing credential access in AWS.</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>EC2 Instance Profile —> Command-Line Options —> Environment Variables</summary>
   <p>False</p>
</details><details>
   <summary>EC2 Instance Profile —> Environment Variables —> Command-Line Options</summary>
