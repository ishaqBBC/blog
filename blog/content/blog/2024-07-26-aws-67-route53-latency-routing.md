## TLDR

Latency-based routing is an effective way to direct users to the nearest resource based on network speed. By assessing and measuring latency, AWS Route 53 ensures users are connected to the closest AWS region, thereby minimising delays for websites and applications. This policy can be combined with health checks to enhance performance. Implementing this in AWS involves creating records with latency routing policies for various regions and testing them using tools such as VPNs and the dig command. This approach helps improve user experience by reducing access times.

## Introduction

Latency-based routing is a method used to direct users to the closest resource in terms of network latency. This is particularly useful when minimizing delay is crucial for your websites or applications.
Latency is measured by the speed at which users can connect to the nearest AWS region identified for that resource. For example, if a user in Germany experiences the lowest latency when connecting to a resource in the US, they will be directed to that US-based resource.

This policy can also be combined with [health checks](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/implementing-health-checks/)

## Visualising Latency-Based Routing

Imagine deploying your application in two different [regions](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2023-01-23-aws-2-getting-started/): us-east-1 (North America) and ap-southeast-1 (Asia Pacific). Users from around the globe will experience different latencies. [AWS Route 53](https://magicishaqblog.netlify.app/2024-04-19-aws-Route53-overview/) evaluates these latencies and directs users to the region with the lowest latency.

For example:

- Users closest to us-east-1 will be routed there.
- Users closer to ap-southeast-1 will be directed to that region.

## Implementing Latency-Based Routing in AWS

Let's put this into practice using the AWS Management Console.

### Guide

Go to the Route 53 in AWS

1. **Create New Records**:

   - **Record Name**: `latency.magicishaq.com`
   - **Value**: IP address for ap-southeast-1
   - **Routing Policy**: Latency
   - **Region**: ap-southeast-1 (Singapore)

   The IP address must be linked to the Singapore region as the Alias isn't capable of identifying the region from the IP alone.

2. **Adding More Records**:
   - Repeat the process for us-east-1 (North America) and eu-central-1 (Europe).

### Example:

- **Record Name**: `latency.magicishaq.com`
- **Value**: IP address for us-east-1
- **Routing Policy**: Latency
- **Region**: us-east-1 (North America)

- **Record Name**: `latency.magicishaq.com`
- **Value**: IP address for eu-central-1
- **Routing Policy**: Latency
- **Region**: eu-central-1 (Europe)

## Testing Latency-Based Routing

Now that we've created the records, let's test them.

1. **In Europe**:

   - Access the URL: `latency.magicishaq.com`
   - Expect a response from the instance in Europe (eu-central-1).

2. **Using VPN for Testing**:

   - Change your location to Canada.
   - Refresh the URL.
   - Expect a response from the US instance (us-east-1).

3. **Testing from Asia**:
   - Change your location to Hong Kong.
   - Refresh the URL.
   - Expect a response from the Singapore instance (ap-southeast-1).

### Verifying with Command Line

Using the `dig` command, you can verify the IP address returned by the DNS query: [HOW TO INSTALL DIG]

```shell
dig latency.magicishaq.com
```

This command should reflect the region with the lowest latency from your current location.

## Conclusion

Latency-based routing is a powerful and commonly used method to ensure users experience the least delay when accessing your resources. By following the steps outlined above, you can implement and test this policy effectively.
