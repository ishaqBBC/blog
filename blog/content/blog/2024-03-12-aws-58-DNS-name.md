## TLDR

DNS is the internet's address book, translating human-readable domain names into computer-friendly IP addresses. It follows a structured hierarchy and involves key terms like Domain Registrar, DNS Records, and Name Servers.

Understanding DNS resolution means tracing a query's path from local to root and TLD servers, finally reaching the domain registrar's server for the IP address.

## Introduction

Welcome to our blog post where we delve into the fundamental concepts of DNS (Domain Name System) in preparation for diving into Route 53. DNS translates human-readable domain names into machine-friendly IP addresses.

## What is DNS?

DNS, short for **Domain Name System**, is a component of internet infrastructure. At its core, DNS translates user-friendly hostnames (like www.google.com) into corresponding IP addresses, allowing web browsers to locate and communicate with servers across the globe.

## Hierarchical Naming Structure

DNS employs a hierarchical naming structure, starting from the root domain (.com, .org, etc.) down to specific subdomains (www.example.com, api.example.com). Understanding this structure is key to navigating the vast web landscape efficiently. Below is a image breaking down the parts of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).

The URL broken down.

1. Protocol.
2. FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name).
3. Sub Domain.
4. SLD (Second Level domain).
5. TLD (Top level domain).
6. Root.

## Key Terminology

Before delving deeper, letâ€™s familiarise ourselves with essential DNS terminology:

- Domain Registrar: The entity where domain names are registered, such as Amazon Route 53 or GoDaddy.
- [DNS Records](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/dns-records/): These records, including A, AAAA, CNAME, NS, etc., define various aspects of DNS configurations.
  Zone File: A file containing DNS records mapping hostnames to IP addresses.
  Name Servers: Servers responsible for resolving DNS queries.
- Top-Level Domains (TLDs): Domains like .com, .org, which reside at the highest level of the DNS hierarchy.
- Second-Level Domains: Domains like amazon.com, google.com, placed directly beneath TLDs.
  Understanding DNS Resolution

## Journey of a DNS query:

- Query Initiation: When you enter a domain name in your web browser, it queries the local DNS server.
- Root DNS Server: If the local server lacks the answer, it consults the root DNS server, which directs it to the appropriate TLD server.
- TLD DNS Server: The TLD server further narrows down the search, guiding the query to the correct domain name server.
- Domain Name Server: Finally, the domain name server managed by the domain registrar provides the IP address associated with the queried domain.

## Conclusion

DNS serves as the communication between users and servers. You'll need to know this before we can explore Amazon Route 53
